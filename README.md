# Harmony of the Spheres
Newtonian n-body gravity simulator

## Run the App Locally
```npm run dev```
   
## Create a Production Build
```npm run build```

## Prettify
```npm run prettier```

[DEMO](https://thehappykoala.github.io/Harmony-of-the-Spheres/)

## To Do List

* Clean up the scene module 
* Develop an integrator with an adaptive time step
* Create a particle system that will allow simulating planetary rings, galaxies and more    
* Add collisions (this point is subject to point 2 getting ticked off first)
* Look into using web workers and or shaders to offload physics calculations from the main thread
* Write a JPL Horizons client in Node to automate the fetching of orbital state vectors for Solar System scenarios
* Add more scenarios!
* Add controllable spacecraft that obey the laws of physics (at least things like thrust, attitude control and orbital insertion maneuvers)
* Any cool ideas you might have!
