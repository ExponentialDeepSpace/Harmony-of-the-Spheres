Now over to the fun part...

## To Do List

* Clean up the scene module 
* Develop an integrator with an adaptive time step
* Create a particle system that will allow simulating planetary rings, galaxies and more
* Add collisions (this point is subject to point 2 getting ticked off first)
* Look into using web workers and or shaders to offload physics calculations from the main thread
* Write a JPL Horizons client in Node to automate the fetching of orbital state vectors for Solar System scenarios
* Add more scenarios!
* Add controllable spacecraft that obey the laws of physics (at least things like thrust, attitude control and orbital insertion maneuvers)
* Any cool ideas you might have!
