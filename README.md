## Objective

The primary objective of Harmony of the Spheres is to make people more interested not only in space, but also in physics and the workings of our dazzling Universe. It is my firm belief that the best way of achieving this objective is by providing people with an interactive, immersive and beautiful learning environment that stimulates people to ask questions and, hopefully, pursue answers to them. 

## Contributing

I intend to open Harmony of the Spheres to contributions from other developers that are passionate about physics and space, but before I can do this, I need to figure out what kind of contributor license agreement is most suitable for this project.

## To Do List

* Clean up the scene module 
* Develop an integrator with an adaptive time step
* Create a particle system that will allow simulating planetary rings, galaxies and more - BIG COMMIT COMING SOON :D! 
* Add collisions (this point is subject to point 2 getting ticked off first)
* Look into using web workers and or shaders to offload physics calculations from the main thread
* Write a JPL Horizons client in Node to automate the fetching of orbital state vectors for Solar System scenarios
* Add more scenarios!
* Add controllable spacecraft that obey the laws of physics (at least things like thrust, attitude control and orbital insertion maneuvers)
* Any cool ideas you might have!
