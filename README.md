# Harmony of the Spheres
Newtonian n-body gravity simulator

[DEMO](https://thehappykoala.github.io/Harmony-of-the-Spheres/)

## Objective

* To provide people with a dazzling, fun and scientifically accurate introduction to physics and space that is accessible to anybody that has a modern browser installed on their device.
* Create simulations that can supplement and bring educational material on space and physics to life on websites such as [WikiPedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
* To assist researchers with reaching out to the public by creating simulations of their research findings, especially around the time of publishing as that is the time when it is most likely that media outlets publish news relating to their research and the public hears about it. I am a strong believer in that interactive and beautifully animated simulations can go a long way towards getting getting laymen more interested in science.

### Introductory Tutorial at CSS-Tricks

If you want to contribute to this project but do not know a thing about physics and scientific programming, I have written a [Tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/creating-your-own-gravity-and-space-simulator/) over at [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) that walks you through how to create your own gravity and space simulator witth JavaScript and the Canvas API. There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project, but even if your intention is not to work with the physics related code, it would probably be nice for you to have a basic understanding of what it is that makes everything go around in Harmony of the Spheres, and it is always awesome to learn something new, right?!
