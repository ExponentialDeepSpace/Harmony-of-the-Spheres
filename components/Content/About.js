You can add planets, delete the Sun, change the value of the gravitational constant or simply lean back and enjoy the dazzling beauty of the pentagram that the orbit of Venus traces when Earth is held fixed at the center of the coordinate system, and much, much more. An overview of the main features of Harmony of the Spheres is provided below."),

For all the solar system scenarios, these positions and velocities were obtained from NASA JPL's Horizon system. If, for example, you increase the mass of Jupiter to that of the Sun, what you will see is what would actually happen if, somehow, this were to occur in reality."),

You can, for instance, look at Mars from Earth, or set the camera position to free and the focus to origo to get a global view of the simulation. When the camera position is set to free, you can also set the focus to any mass in the simulation, and follow it on its path through our beautiful universe, from far away, or up close if you zoom in, and from any angle."),

This allows you to observe peculiar orbits of celestial objects like Earth's quasi moon Cruinthe, but also the aformentioned pentagram that the orbit of Venus traces as seen from Earth. The rotating reference frame feature also makes it possible to beautifully visualize hierarchical systems like, for example, the Sun, Earth and Moon system."),

Want to cause some mayhem? Chuck Jupiter into the inner solar system and see how the orbits of the inner planets get perturbed."),
