        Want to say hi? Is there a scenario that you could not find but would
        like to see included? Got feedback on how I could make Harmony of the
        Spheres more user friendly or would you like to contribute to its
        development? Then I suggest you either shoot me an email or hit me up on
        Twitter! You will find my contact information below.
