  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-235 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-235 is a star with 0.58 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.55 times its radius. It is located 1396.01 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-235 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-235 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-235 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-235 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-235 b is 5.597 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-235 b is 2.230 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-235 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-235 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-235 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-235 c is 2.185 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-235 c is 1.280 that of Earth.  At 2.185 Earth masses, Kepler-235 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-235 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-235 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-235 d is 4.865 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-235 d is 2.050 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.1, and a semi-major axis of 0.122 astronomical units, Kepler-235 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-235 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-235 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-235 e is 5.565 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-235 e is 2.220 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-235 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
