{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-357 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-357 is a star with 0.98 times the mass of the Sun, and 1 times its radius. It is located 1688.47 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-357 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-357 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-357 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-357 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2021-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-357 b is 13.356 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-357 b is 3.720 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-357 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202306,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-357","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"K2-357","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-357","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-357","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":913500,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-357","m":0.98,"radius":9767.441860465116,"temperature":5794,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-357-b","texture":"K2-357-b","m":0.000040080600000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":324.2790697674419,"a":0.145,"e":null,"w":306.41844798174935,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":16.3488637,"temperature":735,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#9D7661","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system K2-357, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the K2.","name":"K2-357 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"K2-357 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
