It is located 356.23 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.43 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 231701 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 231701 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 231701 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 231701 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.57 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 231701 b is 359.34 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 231701 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W.
