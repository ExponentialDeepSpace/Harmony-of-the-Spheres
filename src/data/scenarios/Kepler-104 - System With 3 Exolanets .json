  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-104 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-104 is a star with 0.81 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.35 times its radius. It is located 1307.18 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 12.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-104 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-104 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-104 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-104 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-104 b is 19.716 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-104 b is 3.100 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-104 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-104 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-104 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-104 c is 9.953 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-104 c is 3.130 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-104 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-104 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-104 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-104 d is 12.529 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-104 d is 3.580 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-104 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
