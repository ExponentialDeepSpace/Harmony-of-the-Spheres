  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-1649 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-1649 is a star with 0.2 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.23 times its radius. It is located 300.69 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1649 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1649 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1649 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1649 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2017-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1649 b is 1.033 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1649 b is 1.017 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1649 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-1649 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1649 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1649 c is 1.199 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1649 c is 1.060 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1649 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      Kepler-1649 c orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
