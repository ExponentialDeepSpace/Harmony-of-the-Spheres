It is located 1904.13 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-118 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-118 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-118 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 7.52 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-118.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-118 b is 4.85 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-118 b is 1.96 that of Earth.  At 4.85 Earth masses, Kepler-118 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-118 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-118 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 20.17 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-118.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-118 c is 128.18 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-118 c is 7.68 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-118 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
