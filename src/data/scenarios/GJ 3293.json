It is located 65.88 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 3293 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3293 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 3293 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3293 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 b is 23.55108 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3293 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3293 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3293 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 c is 21.10248 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3293 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3293 d</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3293 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 d is 7.6033800000000005 times the mass of Earth.   At 7.6033800000000005 Earth masses, GJ 3293 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   With a mass of 7.6033800000000005 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.19394 astronomical units, GJ 3293 d could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3293 e</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3293 e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 e is 3.28176 times the mass of Earth.   At 3.28176 Earth masses, GJ 3293 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
