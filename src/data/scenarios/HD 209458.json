It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 209458 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 209458 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 209458 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 209458 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 209458 b is 232.14 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 209458 b is 15.581 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 209458 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 209458, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":296541,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 209458","m":1.23,"radius":11623.255813953489,"temperature":6091,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 209458-b","texture":"HD 209458-b","m":0.000696639,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1357.6744186046512,"a":0.04707,"e":0,"w":101.10453489779078,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.52474859,"temperature":1459,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A78239","clouds":false}]}
