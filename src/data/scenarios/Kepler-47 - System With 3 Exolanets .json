  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-47 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-47 is a star with 0.96 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.94 times its radius. It is located 3343.16 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>Kepler-47 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-47 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-47 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-47 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2012-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.29 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-47 b is 2.070 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-47 b is 3.050 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 0.4, and a semi-major axis of 0.2877 astronomical units, Kepler-47 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-47 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-47 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2012-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.96 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-47 c is 3.170 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-47 c is 4.650 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 0.17, and a semi-major axis of 0.9638 astronomical units, Kepler-47 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-47 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-47 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2019-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-47 d is 19.029 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-47 d is 7.040 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-47 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
