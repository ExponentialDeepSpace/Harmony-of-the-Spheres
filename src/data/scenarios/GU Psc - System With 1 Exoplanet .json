  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GU Psc Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GU Psc is a star with 0.33 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 155.09 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GU Psc is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GU Psc system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GU Psc b</h1>\n      <p>GU Psc b was discovered by the Gemini Observatory observatory, in 2014-05, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 2000.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GU Psc b is 3593.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GU Psc b is 14.179 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GU Psc b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
