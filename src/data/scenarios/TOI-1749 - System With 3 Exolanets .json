  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-1749 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-1749 is a star with 0.58 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.55 times its radius. It is located 324.71 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-1749 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-1749 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-1749 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1749 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1749 b is 57.030 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1749 b is 1.390 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-1749 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-1749 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1749 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1749 c is 14.008 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1749 c is 2.120 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-1749 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-1749 d</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1749 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1749 d is 15.010 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1749 d is 2.520 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-1749 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
