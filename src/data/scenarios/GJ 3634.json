It is located 64.57888799999999 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>GJ 3634 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3634 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 3634 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3634 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the Radial Velocity method. The mass of GJ 3634 b is 8.4 times the mass of Earth.   At 8.4 Earth masses, GJ 3634 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 3634, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 3634","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 3634","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_3634_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 3634","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 3634","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":180810,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 3634","m":0.45,"radius":4200,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 3634-b","texture":"GJ 3634-b","m":0.0000248118,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":11.364159196541875,"a":0.0287,"e":0.08,"w":84,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2.64561,"temperature":780.2214050993414,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_3634_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#5FCA03","clouds":false}]}
