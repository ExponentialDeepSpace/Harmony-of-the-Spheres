It is located 240.04 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-1260 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-1260 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-1260 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1260 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1260 b is 8.605 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1260 b is 2.340 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-1260 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-1260 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1260 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1260 c is 11.807 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1260 c is 2.820 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-1260 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
