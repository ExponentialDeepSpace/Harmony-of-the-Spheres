  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-451 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-451 is a star with 0.95 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.88 times its radius. It is located 403.58 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.12 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-451 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-451 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-451 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-451 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-451 b is 4.325 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-451 b is 1.910 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.4, and a semi-major axis of 0.0283 astronomical units, TOI-451 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-451 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-451 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-451 c is 9.794 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-451 c is 3.100 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-451 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-451 d</h1>\n      <p>TOI-451 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-451 d is 15.582 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-451 d is 4.070 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-451 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
