It is located 355.69 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 147873 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 147873 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 147873 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 147873 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.52 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 147873 b is 1634.520 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 147873 b is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 147873 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 147873 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 147873 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 147873 c is 731.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 147873 c is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 147873 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
