The mass of K2-18 b is 8.92 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-18 b is 2.37 that of Earth.  At 8.92 Earth masses, K2-18 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>K2-18 c</h1>\n            <p>K2-18 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the Radial Velocity method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"K2","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-18, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by K2.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-18","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"K2-18","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/k2-18_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-18","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-18","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":900270,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-18","m":0.36,"radius":4004.6511627906975,"temperature":3457,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-18-c","texture":"K2-18-c","m":0.000022550109000000004,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":10.916998884037772,"a":0.06,"e":0.47,"w":39.45274328676017,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8.962,"temperature":363,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/k2-18_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#A76A82","clouds":false},{"name":"K2-18-b","texture":"K2-18-b","m":0.000026787201000000003,"discoveryFacility":"K2","potentiallyHabitableWorld":true,"radius":206.09302325581396,"a":0.1429,"e":0.2,"w":-5.7,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":32.939623,"temperature":284,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/k2-18_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"color":"#5DC87E","clouds":true}]}
