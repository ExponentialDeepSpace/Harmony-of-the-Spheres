Its semi-major axis is 2.81 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 65891 b is 1908 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 65891 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HIP 65891, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HIP 65891","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HIP 65891","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hip_65891_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HIP 65891","barycenterMassTwo":"HIP 65891","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":17703000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 65891","m":2.5,"radius":87223.25581395348,"temperature":5000,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 65891-b","texture":"HIP 65891-b","m":0.0057258000000000005,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":111.70484955466344,"a":2.81,"e":0.13,"w":355.5,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1084.5,"temperature":285.3325189676967,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hip_65891_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2AE9C4","clouds":false}]}
