{"name":"Kepler-488","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The Kepler-488 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-488 is a star with 1.07 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.09 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.47 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-488 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-488 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-488 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-488 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-488 b is 39432 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-488 b is 15.79 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-488 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-488, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":269640,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-488","m":1.07,"radius":10646.511627906977,"temperature":5970,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-488-b","texture":"Kepler-488-b","m":0.1183332,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1376.232558139535,"a":0.0428,"e":0,"w":49.97686298801615,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.12082923,"temperature":1303,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6648C1","clouds":false}]}
