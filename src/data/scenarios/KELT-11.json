Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KELT-11 b is 54.37800000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KELT-11 b is 15.132 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KELT-11 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KELT-11, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":392427,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KELT-11","m":1.44,"radius":26274.418604651164,"temperature":5375,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KELT-11-b","texture":"KELT-11-b","m":0.0001631853,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1318.6046511627908,"a":0.06229,"e":0.0007,"w":-1,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.7361,"temperature":1712,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#11CDBE","clouds":false}]}
