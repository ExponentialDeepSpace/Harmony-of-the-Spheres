  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-431 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-431 is a star with 0.78 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.73 times its radius. It is located 106.22 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-431 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-431 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-431 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-431 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-431 b is 3.072 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-431 b is 1.280 that of Earth.  At 3.072 Earth masses, TOI-431 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-431 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-431 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-431 c is 2.830 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-431 c is 1.490 that of Earth.  At 2.830 Earth masses, TOI-431 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-431 d</h1>\n      <p>TOI-431 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-431 d is 9.906 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-431 d is 3.290 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-431 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
