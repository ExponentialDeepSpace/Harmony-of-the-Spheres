It is located 1059.03 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10.4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>NGTS-10 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the NGTS-10 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>NGTS-10 b</h1>\n            <p>NGTS-10 b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of NGTS-10 b is 687.516 times the mass of Earth. The radius of NGTS-10 b is 13.507 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, NGTS-10 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Paranal Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system NGTS-10, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Paranal Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"NGTS-10","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"NGTS-10","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ngts-10_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"NGTS-10","barycenterMassTwo":"NGTS-10","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":90090,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"NGTS-10","m":0.7,"radius":6837.209302325581,"temperature":4600,"massType":"star"},{"name":"NGTS-10-b","texture":"NGTS-10-b","m":0.0020631966,"discoveryFacility":"Paranal Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1176.9767441860467,"a":0.0143,"e":0,"w":155.65638251304003,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":0.7668944,"temperature":1332,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ngts-10_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6A5269","clouds":false}]}
