It is located 1956.94 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 11 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>CoRoT-24 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the CoRoT-24 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>CoRoT-24 b</h1>\n            <p>CoRoT-24 b was discovered by the CoRoT observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of CoRoT-24 b is 5.723999999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of CoRoT-24 b is 3.7 that of Earth.  At 5.723999999999999 Earth masses, CoRoT-24 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>CoRoT-24 c</h1>\n            <p>CoRoT-24 c was discovered by the CoRoT observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of CoRoT-24 c is 27.983999999999998 times the mass of Earth. The radius of CoRoT-24 c is 5 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, CoRoT-24 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
