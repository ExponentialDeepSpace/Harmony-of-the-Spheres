It is located 1058.51 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-52 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-52 d</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-52 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 36.45 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-52.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-52 d is 4.78 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-52 d is 1.95 that of Earth.  At 4.78 Earth masses, Kepler-52 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p>With a semi-major axis of 0.182 astronomical units, and a mass of 4.78 Earth masses, Kepler-52 d could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
