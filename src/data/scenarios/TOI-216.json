It is located 583.30 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>TOI-216 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-216 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>TOI-216 b</h1>\n            <p>TOI-216 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-216 b is 30.01602 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-216 b is 7.69 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-216 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>TOI-216 c</h1>\n            <p>TOI-216 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-216 c is 200.10786 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-216 c is 11.29 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-216 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system TOI-216, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TOI-216","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TOI-216","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-216_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"TOI-216","barycenterMassTwo":"TOI-216","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1303470,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-216","m":0.87,"radius":8204.651162790697,"temperature":5026,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-216-c","texture":"TOI-216-c","m":0.0006005123610000001,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":983.5813953488372,"a":0.2069,"e":0.029,"w":275,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":34.556,"temperature":497,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-216_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#4564D7","clouds":false},{"name":"TOI-216-b","texture":"TOI-216-b","m":0.00009007637700000001,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":670.0465116279071,"a":0.1293,"e":0.132,"w":193,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":17.089,"temperature":628,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-216_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FC482C","clouds":false}]}
