Its discovery was announced in 2019-04. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.

The radius of TOI-216 b is 7.69 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-216 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">TOI-216 c</h2>\n            <p>TOI-216 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method.
