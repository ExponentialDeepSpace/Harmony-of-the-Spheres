Its semi-major axis is 0.48 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 70 Vir b is 2358.288 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, 70 Vir b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Lick Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system 70 Vir, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Lick Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"70 Vir","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"70 Vir","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/70_vir_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"70 Vir","barycenterMassTwo":"70 Vir","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":3030300,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"70 Vir","m":1.09,"radius":18460.46511627907,"temperature":5495,"massType":"star"},{"name":"70 Vir-b","texture":"70 Vir-b","m":0.007077088800000001,"discoveryFacility":"Lick Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":122.10115881981382,"a":0.481,"e":0.3988,"w":359.83,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":116.688,"temperature":370.03836992834323,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/70_vir_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#1AE39B","clouds":false}]}
