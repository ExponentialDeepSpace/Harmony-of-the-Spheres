  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HIP 5158 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 5158 is a star with 0.78 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.75 times its radius. It is located 168.30 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 5158 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 5158 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 5158 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 5158 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2010-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.89 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 5158 b is 451.560 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 5158 b is 13.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 5158 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 5158 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 5158 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2011-09, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 7.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 5158 c is 4782.720 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 5158 c is 12.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 5158 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
