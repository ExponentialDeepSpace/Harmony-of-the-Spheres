It is located 156.10 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HD 204313 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 204313 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 204313 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 204313 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 204313 b is 1100.28 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 204313 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 204313 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 204313 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 204313 c is 17.5854 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 204313 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 204313, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 204313","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 204313","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_204313_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 204313","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 204313","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":19341000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 204313","m":1.03,"radius":10744.18604651163,"temperature":5783,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 204313-c","texture":"HD 204313-c","m":0.00005277279,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":15.602459285766527,"a":0.2099,"e":0.155,"w":238,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":34.905,"temperature":536.8724558477504,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_204313_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#7AFFBE","clouds":false},{"name":"HD 204313-b","texture":"HD 204313-b","m":0.0033018780000000003,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":88.64626958310036,"a":3.07,"e":0.23,"w":10.938065583963494,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1920.09998,"temperature":140.38094275747295,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_204313_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6D5280","clouds":false}]}
