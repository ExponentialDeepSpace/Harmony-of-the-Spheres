  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-216 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-216 is a star with 0.87 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.84 times its radius. It is located 580.38 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-216 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-216 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-216 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-216 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-216 c is 200.108 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-216 c is 11.290 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-216 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-216 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-216 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-216 b is 30.016 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-216 b is 7.690 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-216 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
