  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-215 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-215 is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.03 times its radius. It is located 1585.11 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.62 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-215 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-215 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-215 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-215 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-215 b is 3.244 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-215 b is 1.620 that of Earth.  At 3.244 Earth masses, Kepler-215 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-215 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-215 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-215 c is 3.784 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-215 c is 1.770 that of Earth.  At 3.784 Earth masses, Kepler-215 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-215 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-215 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-215 d is 23.532 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-215 d is 2.390 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-215 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-215 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-215 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.31 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-215 e is 3.721 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-215 e is 1.750 that of Earth.  At 3.721 Earth masses, Kepler-215 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
