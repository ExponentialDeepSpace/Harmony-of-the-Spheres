{"name":"DMPP-1","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The DMPP-1 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>DMPP-1 is a star with 1.21 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.26 times its radius. It is located 202.22 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.01 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>DMPP-1 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the DMPP-1 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>DMPP-1 b</h1>\n            <p>DMPP-1 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of DMPP-1 b is 24.28248 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, DMPP-1 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>DMPP-1 c</h1>\n            <p>DMPP-1 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of DMPP-1 c is 9.6036 times the mass of Earth.   At 9.6036 Earth masses, DMPP-1 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>DMPP-1 d</h1>\n            <p>DMPP-1 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of DMPP-1 d is 3.3517200000000003 times the mass of Earth.   At 3.3517200000000003 Earth masses, DMPP-1 d is a so called Super Earth.

Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of DMPP-1 e is 4.13082 times the mass of Earth.   At 4.13082 Earth masses, DMPP-1 e is a so called Super Earth.
