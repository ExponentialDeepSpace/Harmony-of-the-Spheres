{"name":"Kepler-1421","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The Kepler-1421 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-1421 is a star with 1.25 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.42 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.75 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1421 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1421 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1421 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1421 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1421 b is 0.75048 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1421 b is 0.93 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1421 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-1421, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":480060,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-1421","m":1.25,"radius":13869.767441860464,"temperature":6335,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-1421-b","texture":"Kepler-1421-b","m":0.000002252148,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":81.06976744186048,"a":0.0762,"e":0,"w":273.32241682637266,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":6.9131112,"temperature":1209,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#5AE240","clouds":false}]}
