  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TRAPPIST-1 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TRAPPIST-1 is a star with 0.09 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.12 times its radius. It is located 40.54 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TRAPPIST-1 is known to have 7 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 b</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 b is 1.374 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 b is 1.116 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 c</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method.

Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 h is 0.328 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 h is 0.755 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 h is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.06189 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1, TRAPPIST-1 h is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
