It is located 64.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>7 CMa is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the 7 CMa system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>7 CMa b</h1>\n            <p>7 CMa b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.76 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 7 CMa b is 588.3000000000001 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, 7 CMa b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>7 CMa c</h1>\n            <p>7 CMa c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method.
