It is located 3610.55 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-67 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-67 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-67 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2013-07. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 15.73 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-67.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-67 b is 12.77 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-67 b is 2.94 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-67 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
