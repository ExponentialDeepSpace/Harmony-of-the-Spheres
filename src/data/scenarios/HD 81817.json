It is located 877.26 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.15 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 81817 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 81817 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 81817 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 81817 b was discovered by the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomical Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.30 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 81817 b is 8617.800000000001 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 81817 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Bohyunsan Optical Astronomical Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 81817, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Bohyunsan Optical Astronomical Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 81817","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 81817","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_81817_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 81817","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 81817","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":20790000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 81817","m":4.3,"radius":818511.6279069767,"temperature":4140,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 81817-b","texture":"HD 81817-b","m":0.025861530000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Bohyunsan Optical Astronomical Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":210.42416136525523,"a":3.3,"e":0.17,"w":320,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1047.1,"temperature":395.45201758099824,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_81817_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#5FE41E","clouds":false}]}
