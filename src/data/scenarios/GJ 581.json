{"name":"GJ 581","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The GJ 581 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>GJ 581 is a star with 0.31 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.29 times its radius. It is located 20.55 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>GJ 581 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 581 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 581 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 581 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 581 b is 15.8046 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 581 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 581 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 581 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 581 c is 5.501399999999999 times the mass of Earth.   At 5.501399999999999 Earth masses, GJ 581 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 581 e</h1>\n            <p>GJ 581 e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 581 e is 1.6854 times the mass of Earth.   At 1.6854 Earth masses, GJ 581 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 581, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 581","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 581","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_581_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 581","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 581","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":454230,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 581","m":0.31,"radius":2832.5581395348836,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 581-e","texture":"GJ 581-e","m":0.00000505779,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":5.826991278418945,"a":0.02815,"e":0,"w":324.0873720002156,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.149,"temperature":595.7053420161023,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_581_e/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#CB7C2E","clouds":false},{"name":"GJ 581-c","texture":"GJ 581-c","m":0.00001650939,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":9.576964247825979,"a":0.0721,"e":0,"w":228.94565635128566,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":12.914,"temperature":372.2228772918898,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_581_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#9F34B4","clouds":false},{"name":"GJ 581-b","texture":"GJ 581-b","m":0.00004742871,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":14.918260487595198,"a":0.04061,"e":0,"w":14.696036727535287,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.3686,"temperature":495.96862003563166,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_581_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2240C1","clouds":false}]}
