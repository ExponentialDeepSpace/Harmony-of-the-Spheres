  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 667 C Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 667 C is a star with 0.33 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 23.63 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 667 C is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 667 C system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 667 C b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 667 C b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 667 C b is 5.724 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 667 C b is 2.230 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 667 C b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 667 C c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 667 C c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 667 C c is 3.816 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 667 C c is 1.770 that of Earth.  At 3.816 Earth masses, GJ 667 C c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     GJ 667 C c orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 667 C e</h1>\n      <p>GJ 667 C e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 667 C e is 2.544 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 667 C e is 1.450 that of Earth.  At 2.544 Earth masses, GJ 667 C e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     GJ 667 C e orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 667 C f</h1>\n      <p>GJ 667 C f was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 667 C f is 2.544 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 667 C f is 1.450 that of Earth.  At 2.544 Earth masses, GJ 667 C f is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.

GJ 667 C f orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 667 C g</h1>\n      <p>GJ 667 C g was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.55 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 667 C g is 4.452 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 667 C g is 1.990 that of Earth.    With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.549 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of GJ 667 C, GJ 667 C g is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
