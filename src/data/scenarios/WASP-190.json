The mass of WASP-190 b is 317.83 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-190 b is 12.89 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-190 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-190 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"WASP-South","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-190, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by WASP-South.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-190","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-190","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-190","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-190","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":417690,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-190","m":1.35,"radius":15627.906976744187,"temperature":6400,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-190-b","texture":"WASP-190-b","m":0.0009543,"discoveryFacility":"WASP-South","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1123.2558139534883,"a":0.0663,"e":0,"w":164.51880902128534,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.367753,"temperature":1500,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#04D616","clouds":false}]}
