It is located 268.01 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-1062 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-1062 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-1062 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1062 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1062 b is 10.157 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1062 b is 2.265 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-1062 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-1062 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1062 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1062 c is 9.785 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1062 c is 3.100 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-1062 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
