It is located 355.51 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.48 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 106315 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 106315 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 106315 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 106315 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 106315 b is 12.60552 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 106315 b is 2.44 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 106315 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 106315 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 106315 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 106315 c is 15.206760000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 106315 c is 4.35 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 106315 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
