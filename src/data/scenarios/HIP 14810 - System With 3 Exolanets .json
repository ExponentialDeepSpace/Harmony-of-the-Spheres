  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HIP 14810 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 14810 is a star with 1.01 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.07 times its radius. It is located 164.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.84 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 14810 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 14810 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 14810 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 14810 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2006-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 14810 b is 1240.200 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 14810 b is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 14810 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 14810 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 14810 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2007-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.55 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 14810 c is 416.580 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 14810 c is 13.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 14810 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 14810 d</h1>\n      <p>HIP 14810 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2009-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.94 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 14810 d is 187.620 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 14810 d is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 14810 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
