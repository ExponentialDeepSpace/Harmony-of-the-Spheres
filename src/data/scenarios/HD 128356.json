Its semi-major axis is 0.87 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 128356 b is 283.02 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 128356 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 128356, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 128356","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 128356","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_128356_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 128356","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 128356","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":5481000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 128356","m":0.65,"radius":8302.32558139535,"temperature":4875,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 128356-b","texture":"HD 128356-b","m":0.0008493270000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":50.11783541854042,"a":0.87,"e":0.57,"w":84.22,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":298.2,"temperature":186.71311094532294,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_128356_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#F5C8D3","clouds":false}]}
