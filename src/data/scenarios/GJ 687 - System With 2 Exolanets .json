It is located 14.84 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 687 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 687 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 687 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 687 b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory, in 2014-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 687 b is 17.210 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 687 b is 4.320 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 687 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 687 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 687 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2020-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 687 c is 16.008 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 687 c is 4.140 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 687 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
