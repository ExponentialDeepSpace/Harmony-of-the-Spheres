  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-148 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-148 is a star with 0.65 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.63 times its radius. It is located 405.93 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-148 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-148 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-148 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-148 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-148 b is 2.331 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-148 b is 1.330 that of Earth.  At 2.331 Earth masses, K2-148 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-148 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-148 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-148 c is 3.657 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-148 c is 1.730 that of Earth.  At 3.657 Earth masses, K2-148 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-148 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-148 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-148 d is 3.339 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-148 d is 1.640 that of Earth.  At 3.339 Earth masses, K2-148 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
