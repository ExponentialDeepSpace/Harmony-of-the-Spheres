  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 317 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 317 is a star with 0.42 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 49.57 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 317 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 317 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 317 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 317 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2007-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 317 b is 795.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 317 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 317 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 317 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 317 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2016-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 317 c is 522.779 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 317 c is 13.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 317 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
