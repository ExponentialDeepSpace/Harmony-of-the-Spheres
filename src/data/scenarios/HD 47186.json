It is located 122.31 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>HD 47186 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">HD 47186 b</h2>\n            <p>HD 47186 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its discovery was announced in 2009-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 4.08 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, HD 47186.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.04, which means that when HD 47186 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.05 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.05.

At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 47186 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">HD 47186 c</h2>\n            <p>HD 47186 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method.
