It is located 123.44 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.39 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 12661 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 12661 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 12661 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 12661 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2001-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.84 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 12661 b is 772.740 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 12661 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 12661 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 12661 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 12661 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2003-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.81 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 12661 c is 576.216 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 12661 c is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 12661 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
