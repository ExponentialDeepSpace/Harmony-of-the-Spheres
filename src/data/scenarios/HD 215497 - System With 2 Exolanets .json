  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 215497 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 215497 is a star with 0.67 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.85 times its radius. It is located 132.25 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 215497 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 215497 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 215497 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 215497 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2010-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215497 b is 6.360 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 215497 b is 2.400 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 215497 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 215497 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 215497 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2010-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215497 c is 104.940 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 215497 c is 12.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 215497 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
