{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The YSES 2 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>YSES 2 is a star with 1.1 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.19 times its radius. It is located 356.83 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.014 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>YSES 2 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the YSES 2 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>YSES 2 b</h1>\n      <p>YSES 2 b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory, in 2021-04, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 115.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of YSES 2 b is 2003.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of YSES 2 b is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, YSES 2 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Imaging","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"YSES 2","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"YSES 2","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"YSES 2","barycenterMassTwo":"YSES 2","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":724500000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"YSES 2","m":1.1,"radius":11623.255813953489,"temperature":4749,"massType":"star"},{"name":"YSES 2-b","texture":"YSES 2-b","m":0.00601209,"discoveryFacility":"Imaging","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1113.4883720930231,"a":115,"e":0,"w":325.1763841803482,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":null,"temperature":24.096003498877547,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6490A5","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system YSES 2, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Paranal Observatory.","name":"YSES 2 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"YSES 2 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
