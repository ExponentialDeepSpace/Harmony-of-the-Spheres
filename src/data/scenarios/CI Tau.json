{"name":"CI Tau","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The CI Tau Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>CI Tau is a star with 0.9 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.003 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>CI Tau is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the CI Tau system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>CI Tau b</h1>\n      <p>CI Tau b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of CI Tau b is 3688.7999999999997 times the mass of Earth. The radius of CI Tau b is 12.4 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, CI Tau b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system CI Tau, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"CI Tau","m":0.9,"radius":null,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"CI Tau-b","texture":"CI Tau-b","m":0.01106988,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1084.186046511628,"a":null,"e":0.25,"w":31,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8.9891,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#7B1E09","clouds":false}]}
