It is located 92.92 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 3138 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3138 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 3138 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3138 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3138 b is 1.7808 times the mass of Earth.   At 1.7808 Earth masses, GJ 3138 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3138 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3138 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3138 c is 4.1817 times the mass of Earth.   At 4.1817 Earth masses, GJ 3138 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3138 d</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3138 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3138 d is 10.50672 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3138 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
