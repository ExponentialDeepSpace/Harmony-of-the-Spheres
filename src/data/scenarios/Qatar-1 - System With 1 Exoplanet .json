It is located 605.39 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.19 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Qatar-1 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Qatar-1 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Qatar-1 b</h1>\n      <p>Qatar-1 b was discovered by the Qatar observatory, in 2011-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Qatar-1 b is 411.492 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Qatar-1 b is 12.812 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Qatar-1 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
