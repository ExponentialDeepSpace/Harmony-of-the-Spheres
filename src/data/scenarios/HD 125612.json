It is located 188.26 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.77 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 125612 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 125612 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 125612 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 125612 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.37 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 125612 b is 985.8000000000001 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 125612 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 125612 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 125612 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 125612 c is 17.49 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 125612 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 125612 d</h1>\n            <p>HD 125612 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 4.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 125612 d is 2315.04 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 125612 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W.
