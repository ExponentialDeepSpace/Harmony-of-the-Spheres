{"name":"LTT 1445 A","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The LTT 1445 A Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>LTT 1445 A is a star with 0.26 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.28 times its radius. It is located 22.41 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>LTT 1445 A is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the LTT 1445 A system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>LTT 1445 A b</h1>\n            <p>LTT 1445 A b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LTT 1445 A b is 2.20056 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 1445 A b is 1.38 that of Earth.  At 2.20056 Earth masses, LTT 1445 A b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system LTT 1445 A, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"LTT 1445 A","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"LTT 1445 A","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ltt_1445a_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"LTT 1445 A","barycenterMassTwo":"LTT 1445 A","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":239841,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"LTT 1445 A","m":0.26,"radius":2734.883720930233,"temperature":3337,"massType":"star"},{"name":"LTT 1445 A-b","texture":"LTT 1445 A-b","m":0.000006603756000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":120.13953488372094,"a":0.03807,"e":0.19,"w":-139,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.35882,"temperature":433,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ltt_1445a_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#75B02E","clouds":false}]}
