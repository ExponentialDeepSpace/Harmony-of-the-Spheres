It is located 22.41 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>LTT 1445 A is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">LTT 1445 A b</h2>\n            <p>LTT 1445 A b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2019-07. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 5.36 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, LTT 1445 A.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.19, which means that when LTT 1445 A b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.03 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.05. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of LTT 1445 A b is 2.20 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 1445 A b is 1.38 that of Earth.  At 2.20 Earth masses, LTT 1445 A b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
