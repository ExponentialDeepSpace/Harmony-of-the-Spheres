It is located 560.99 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-186 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-186 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-186 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 3.89 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-186.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-186 b is 1.12 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-186 b is 1.07 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-186 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-186 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-186 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method.
