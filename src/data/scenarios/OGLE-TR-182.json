Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of OGLE-TR-182 b is 321.18 times the mass of Earth. The radius of OGLE-TR-182 b is 12.666 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, OGLE-TR-182 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"OGLE","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system OGLE-TR-182, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by OGLE.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"OGLE-TR-182","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"OGLE-TR-182","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ogle-tr-182_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"OGLE-TR-182","barycenterMassTwo":"OGLE-TR-182","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":321300,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"OGLE-TR-182","m":1.14,"radius":11134.883720930231,"temperature":5924,"massType":"star"},{"name":"OGLE-TR-182-b","texture":"OGLE-TR-182-b","m":0.000963843,"discoveryFacility":"OGLE","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1103.7209302325582,"a":0.051,"e":0,"w":73.09555944550333,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.9791,"temperature":1175.284407335451,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ogle-tr-182_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2B9A10","clouds":false}]}
