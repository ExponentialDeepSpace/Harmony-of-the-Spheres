It is located 372.7636924 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>K2-292 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-292 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>K2-292 b</h1>\n            <p>K2-292 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method. The mass of K2-292 b is 24.5 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-292 b is 2.63 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-292 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"K2","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-292, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by K2.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-292","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"K2-292","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_119130_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-292","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-292","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":819000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-292","m":1,"radius":10646.511627906977,"temperature":5725,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-292-b","texture":"K2-292-b","m":0.000073566987,"discoveryFacility":"K2","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":229.53488372093022,"a":0.13,"e":0.04,"w":104,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":16.9841,"temperature":795,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_119130_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#84408A","clouds":false}]}
