  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-146 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-146 is a star with 0.33 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.33 times its radius. It is located 258.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>K2-146 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-146 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-146 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-146 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-146 b is 5.775 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-146 b is 2.050 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-146 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-146 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-146 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-146 c is 7.498 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-146 c is 2.190 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-146 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
