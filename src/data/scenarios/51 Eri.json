It is located 95.89 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.02 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>51 Eri is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">51 Eri b</h2>\n            <p>51 Eri b was discovered by the Gemini Observatory observatory using the imaging method. Its discovery was announced in 2015-08. Its semi-major axis is 12.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 11688.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, 51 Eri.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.45, which means that when 51 Eri b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 6.60 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 17.40. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of 51 Eri b is 0.00 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, 51 Eri b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
