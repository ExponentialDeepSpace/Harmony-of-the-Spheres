  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 215152 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 215152 is a star with 0.77 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.73 times its radius. It is located 70.44 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 215152 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 215152 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 215152 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 215152 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2018-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215152 b is 1.819 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 215152 b is 1.190 that of Earth.  At 1.819 Earth masses, HD 215152 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 215152 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 215152 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2018-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215152 c is 1.720 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 215152 c is 1.170 that of Earth.  At 1.720 Earth masses, HD 215152 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 215152 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 215152 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2018-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215152 d is 2.802 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 215152 d is 1.480 that of Earth.  At 2.802 Earth masses, HD 215152 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 215152 e</h1>\n      <p>HD 215152 e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2018-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215152 e is 2.878 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 215152 e is 1.510 that of Earth.  At 2.878 Earth masses, HD 215152 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
