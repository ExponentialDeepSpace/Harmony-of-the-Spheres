  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 3138 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 3138 is a star with 0.68 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.5 times its radius. It is located 92.86 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 3138 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3138 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 3138 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3138 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3138 b is 1.781 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3138 b is 1.180 that of Earth.  At 1.781 Earth masses, GJ 3138 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 3138 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3138 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3138 c is 4.182 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3138 c is 1.880 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.46, and a semi-major axis of 0.057 astronomical units, GJ 3138 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 3138 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3138 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3138 d is 10.507 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3138 d is 3.230 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3138 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
