  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The 14 Her Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>14 Her is a star with 0.9 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.93 times its radius. It is located 58.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>14 Her is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the 14 Her system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>14 Her b</h1>\n      <p>14 Her b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2003-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.93 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 14 Her b is 1481.880 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 14 Her b is 12.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 14 Her b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>14 Her c</h1>\n      <p>14 Her c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 16.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 14 Her c is 1844.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 14 Her c is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 14 Her c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
