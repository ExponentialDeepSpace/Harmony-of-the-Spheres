It is located 17.35 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 3323 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3323 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 3323 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3323 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3323 b is 2.0224800000000003 times the mass of Earth.   At 2.0224800000000003 Earth masses, GJ 3323 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3323 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3323 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3323 c is 2.3118600000000002 times the mass of Earth.   At 2.3118600000000002 Earth masses, GJ 3323 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
