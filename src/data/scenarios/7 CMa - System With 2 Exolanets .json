  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The 7 CMa Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>7 CMa is a star with 1.34 times the mass of the Sun, and 4.87 times its radius. It is located 64.61 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>7 CMa is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the 7 CMa system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>7 CMa b</h1>\n      <p>7 CMa b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2011-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.76 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 7 CMa b is 588.300 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 7 CMa b is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 7 CMa b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>7 CMa c</h1>\n      <p>7 CMa c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2019-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 7 CMa c is 276.660 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 7 CMa c is 13.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 7 CMa c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
