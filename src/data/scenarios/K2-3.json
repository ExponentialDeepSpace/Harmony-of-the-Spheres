{"name":"K2-3","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-3 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-3 is a star with 0.6 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.56 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>K2-3 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-3 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-3 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-3 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-3 b is 6.484019999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-3 b is 1.98 that of Earth.  At 6.484019999999999 Earth masses, K2-3 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-3 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-3 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-3 c is 2.14014 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-3 c is 1.56 that of Earth.  At 2.14014 Earth masses, K2-3 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-3 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-3 d was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-3 d is 2.80158 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-3 d is 1.53 that of Earth.  At 2.80158 Earth masses, K2-3 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
