  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HIP 57274 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 57274 is a star with 0.29 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.78 times its radius. It is located 84.35 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.87 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 57274 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 57274 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 57274 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 57274 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2012-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 57274 b is 6.360 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 57274 b is 2.400 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 57274 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 57274 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 57274 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2012-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 57274 c is 130.068 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 57274 c is 14.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 57274 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 57274 d</h1>\n      <p>HIP 57274 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2012-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 57274 d is 167.491 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 57274 d is 14.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 57274 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
