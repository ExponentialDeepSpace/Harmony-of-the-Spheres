  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-192 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-192 is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.01 times its radius. It is located 2125.47 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-192 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-192 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-192 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-192 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-192 b is 7.950 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-192 b is 2.740 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-192 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-192 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-192 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-192 c is 8.204 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-192 c is 2.790 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-192 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-192 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-192 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-192 d is 1.043 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-192 d is 1.020 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-192 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
