{"name":"K2-170","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-170 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-170 is a star with 0.96 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.98 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-170 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-170 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-170 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-170 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-170 b is 2.5980600000000003 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-170 b is 1.418 that of Earth.  At 2.5980600000000003 Earth masses, K2-170 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-170 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-170 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-170 c is 3.9114 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-170 c is 1.802 that of Earth.  At 3.9114 Earth masses, K2-170 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
