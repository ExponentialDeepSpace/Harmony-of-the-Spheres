{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The LHS 1478 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>LHS 1478 is a star with 0.24 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.25 times its radius. It is located 59.45 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>LHS 1478 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LHS 1478 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LHS 1478 b</h1>\n      <p>LHS 1478 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LHS 1478 b is 2.331 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LHS 1478 b is 1.242 that of Earth.  At 2.331 Earth masses, LHS 1478 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"LHS 1478","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"LHS 1478","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"LHS 1478","barycenterMassTwo":"LHS 1478","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":116424,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"LHS 1478","m":0.24,"radius":2441.860465116279,"temperature":3381,"massType":"star"},{"name":"LHS 1478-b","texture":"LHS 1478-b","m":0.000006995019,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":108.4186046511628,"a":0.01848,"e":0,"w":338.06070528400176,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.9495378,"temperature":595,"exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"color":"#5E03F4","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system LHS 1478, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","name":"LHS 1478 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"LHS 1478 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
