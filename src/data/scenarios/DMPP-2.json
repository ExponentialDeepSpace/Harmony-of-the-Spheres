It is located 437.05 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>DMPP-2 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the DMPP-2 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>DMPP-2 b</h1>\n            <p>DMPP-2 b was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of DMPP-2 b is 138.966 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, DMPP-2 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Facilities","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system DMPP-2, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Facilities.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"DMPP-2","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"DMPP-2","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_11231_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"DMPP-2","barycenterMassTwo":"DMPP-2","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":418320,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"DMPP-2","m":1.44,"radius":17386.04651162791,"temperature":6500,"massType":"star"},{"name":"DMPP-2-b","texture":"DMPP-2-b","m":0.0004170291,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Facilities","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":37.174976816417995,"a":0.0664,"e":0.078,"w":295.7829110064467,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.2072,"temperature":1000,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_11231_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#36D558","clouds":false}]}
