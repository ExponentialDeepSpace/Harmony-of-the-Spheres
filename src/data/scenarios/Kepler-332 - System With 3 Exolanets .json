  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-332 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-332 is a star with 0.8 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.72 times its radius. It is located 1122.60 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.82 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-332 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-332 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-332 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-332 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-332 b is 1.708 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-332 b is 1.170 that of Earth.  At 1.708 Earth masses, Kepler-332 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-332 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-332 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-332 c is 1.323 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-332 c is 1.090 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-332 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-332 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-332 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-332 d is 1.759 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-332 d is 1.180 that of Earth.  At 1.759 Earth masses, Kepler-332 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
