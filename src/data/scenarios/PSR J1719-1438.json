It is located 3913.872 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 12.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>PSR J1719-1438 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the PSR J1719-1438 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>PSR J1719-1438 b</h1>\n            <p>PSR J1719-1438 b was discovered by the Parkes Observatory observatory using the Pulsar Timing method. The mass of PSR J1719-1438 b is 382.8 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, PSR J1719-1438 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, PSR J1719-1438 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Parkes Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system PSR J1719-1438, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Parkes Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"PSR J1719-1438","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"PSR J1719-1438","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/psr_1719-14_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"PSR J1719-1438","barycenterMassTwo":"PSR J1719-1438","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":27720,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"PSR J1719-1438","m":1.4,"radius":390.69767441860466,"temperature":4500,"massType":"star"},{"name":"PSR J1719-1438-b","texture":"PSR J1719-1438-b","m":0.00114516,"discoveryFacility":"Parkes Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":56.8204444121015,"a":0.0044,"e":0.06,"w":42.3126701376591,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":0.09070629,"temperature":4667.873868796497,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/psr_1719-14_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6AE56C","clouds":false}]}
