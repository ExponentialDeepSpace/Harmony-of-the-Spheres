It is located 3913.87 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 12.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>PSR J1719-1438 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">PSR J1719-1438 b</h2>\n            <p>PSR J1719-1438 b was discovered by the Parkes Observatory observatory using the pulsar timing method. Its discovery was announced in 2011-09. Its semi-major axis is 0.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 0.09 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, PSR J1719-1438.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.06, which means that when PSR J1719-1438 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.00 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.00. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of PSR J1719-1438 b is 381.37 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, PSR J1719-1438 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
