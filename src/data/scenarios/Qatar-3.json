{"name":"Qatar-3","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The Qatar-3 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>Qatar-3 is a star with 1.15 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.27 times its radius. It is located 2449.40 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.31 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Qatar-3 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Qatar-3 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Qatar-3 b</h1>\n            <p>Qatar-3 b was discovered by the Qatar observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Qatar-3 b is 1370.58 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Qatar-3 b is 12.285 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Qatar-3 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Qatar","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Qatar-3, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Qatar.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Qatar-3","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Qatar-3","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/qatar-3_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Qatar-3","barycenterMassTwo":"Qatar-3","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":238329,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Qatar-3","m":1.15,"radius":12404.651162790698,"temperature":6007,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Qatar-3-b","texture":"Qatar-3-b","m":0.0041130329999999994,"discoveryFacility":"Qatar","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1070.5116279069769,"a":0.03783,"e":0,"w":263.42248718634863,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2.5079204,"temperature":1681,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/qatar-3_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#486388","clouds":false}]}
