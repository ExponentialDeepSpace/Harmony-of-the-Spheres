It is located 1713.95 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.29 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-107 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-107 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-107 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 3.18 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-107.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0, which means that when Kepler-107 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.05 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.05.
