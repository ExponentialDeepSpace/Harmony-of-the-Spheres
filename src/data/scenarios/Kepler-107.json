The mass of Kepler-107 b is 3.51 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-107 b is 1.536 that of Earth.  At 3.51 Earth masses, Kepler-107 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-107 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-107 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method.
