Its semi-major axis is 2.55 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 97233 b is 6360 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 97233 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HIP 97233, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HIP 97233","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HIP 97233","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hip_97233_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HIP 97233","barycenterMassTwo":"HIP 97233","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":16065000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 97233","m":1.93,"radius":52158.13953488372,"temperature":5020,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 97233-b","texture":"HIP 97233-b","m":0.019086000000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":185.21710894122515,"a":2.55,"e":0.61,"w":249.3,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1058.8,"temperature":246.68759752322492,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hip_97233_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#0BF9F7","clouds":false}]}
