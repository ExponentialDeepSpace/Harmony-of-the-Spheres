It is located 16.19 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 832 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 832 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 832 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 832 b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2009-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.56 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 832 b is 216.240 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 832 b is 14.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 832 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 832 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 832 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 832 c is 5.406 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 832 c is 2.180 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 832 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
