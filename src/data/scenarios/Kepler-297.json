Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.22 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 38.87 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-297.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-297 b is 12.08 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-297 b is 2.87 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-297 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-297 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-297 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.34 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 74.92 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-297.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-297 c is 87.05 times the mass of Earth.
