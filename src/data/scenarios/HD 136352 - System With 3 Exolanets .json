  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 136352 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 136352 is a star with 0.81 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 47.89 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 136352 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 136352 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 136352 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 136352 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 136352 b is 4.802 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 136352 b is 2.040 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.11, and a semi-major axis of 0.0934 astronomical units, HD 136352 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 136352 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 136352 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 136352 c is 10.812 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 136352 c is 3.280 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 136352 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 136352 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 136352 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.41 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 136352 d is 8.586 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 136352 d is 2.870 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 136352 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
