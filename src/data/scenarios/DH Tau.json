It is located 456.61839999999995 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.001 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>DH Tau is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the DH Tau system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>DH Tau b</h1>\n            <p>DH Tau b was discovered by the Subaru Telescope observatory using the Imaging method. The mass of DH Tau b is 3496 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, DH Tau b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, DH Tau b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Subaru Telescope","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system DH Tau, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Subaru Telescope.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"DH Tau","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"DH Tau","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/dh_tau_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"DH Tau","barycenterMassTwo":"DH Tau","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":2079000000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"DH Tau","m":0.33,"radius":2637.2093023255816,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"DH Tau-b","texture":"DH Tau-b","m":0.010497300000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Subaru Telescope","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":144.08986371616447,"a":330,"e":0,"w":304.25726903071336,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":null,"temperature":5.766043425719552,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/dh_tau_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#7A4792","clouds":false}]}
