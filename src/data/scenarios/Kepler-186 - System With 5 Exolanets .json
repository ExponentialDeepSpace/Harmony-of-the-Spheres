  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-186 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-186 is a star with 0.48 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.47 times its radius. It is located 579.23 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-186 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-186 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-186 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-186 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-186 b is 1.240 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-186 b is 1.070 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-186 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-186 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-186 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-186 c is 2.099 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-186 c is 1.250 that of Earth.  At 2.099 Earth masses, Kepler-186 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-186 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-186 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-186 d is 2.544 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-186 d is 1.400 that of Earth.  At 2.544 Earth masses, Kepler-186 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-186 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-186 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-186 e is 2.156 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-186 e is 1.270 that of Earth.  At 2.156 Earth masses, Kepler-186 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-186 f</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-186 f was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.43 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-186 f is 1.708 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-186 f is 1.170 that of Earth.  At 1.708 Earth masses, Kepler-186 f is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.432 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of Kepler-186, Kepler-186 f is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
