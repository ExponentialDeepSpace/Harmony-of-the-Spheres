{"name":"KIC 9663113","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The KIC 9663113 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>KIC 9663113 is a star with 0.98 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.03 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>KIC 9663113 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the KIC 9663113 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>KIC 9663113 b</h1>\n      <p>KIC 9663113 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 1.41 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KIC 9663113 b is 19.1754 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KIC 9663113 b is 4.6 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, KIC 9663113 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KIC 9663113 c</h1>\n      <p>KIC 9663113 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method.
