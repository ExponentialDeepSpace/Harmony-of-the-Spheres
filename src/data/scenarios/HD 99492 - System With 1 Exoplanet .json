It is located 59.37 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 99492 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 99492 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 99492 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 99492 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2005-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 99492 b is 22.260 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 99492 b is 5.020 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 99492 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
