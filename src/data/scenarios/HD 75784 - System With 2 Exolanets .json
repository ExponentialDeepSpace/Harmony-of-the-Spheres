It is located 278.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 75784 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 75784 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 75784 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 75784 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2015-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 75784 b is 318.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 75784 b is 13.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 75784 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 75784 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 75784 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2018-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 8.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 75784 c is 1793.520 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 75784 c is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 75784 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
