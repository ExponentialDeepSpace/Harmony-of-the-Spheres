Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-5 b is 671.2980000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-5 b is 15.984 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-5 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-5, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-5","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-5","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-5_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-5","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-5","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":338940,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-5","m":1.37,"radius":17483.720930232557,"temperature":6297,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-5-b","texture":"Kepler-5-b","m":0.0020145273000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1392.8372093023256,"a":0.0538,"e":0,"w":304.36623875248773,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.5484657,"temperature":1750,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-5_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#396A70","clouds":false}]}
