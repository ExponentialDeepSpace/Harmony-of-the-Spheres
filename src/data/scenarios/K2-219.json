{"name":"K2-219","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-219 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-219 is a star with 1.02 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.19 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-219 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-219 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-219 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-219 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-219 b is 2.385 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-219 b is 1.348 that of Earth.  At 2.385 Earth masses, K2-219 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-219 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-219 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-219 c is 2.6616600000000004 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-219 c is 1.438 that of Earth.  At 2.6616600000000004 Earth masses, K2-219 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.

Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-219 d is 7.154999999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-219 d is 2.576 that of Earth.  At 7.154999999999999 Earth masses, K2-219 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
