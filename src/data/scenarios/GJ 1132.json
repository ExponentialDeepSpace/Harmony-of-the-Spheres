The mass of GJ 1132 b is 1.66 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1132 b is 1.13 that of Earth.  At 1.66 Earth masses, GJ 1132 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 1132 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 1132 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the Radial Velocity method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 1132, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 1132","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 1132","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1132_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 1132","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 1132","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":299880,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 1132","m":0.18,"radius":2051.162790697674,"temperature":3270,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 1132-c","texture":"GJ 1132-c","m":0.000007930233,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":7.038513254990322,"a":0.0476,"e":0.27,"w":32.54534651533972,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8.929,"temperature":300,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1132_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#139CFD","clouds":false},{"name":"GJ 1132-b","texture":"GJ 1132-b","m":0.000004981446,"discoveryFacility":"Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":98.65116279069768,"a":0.0153,"e":0.22,"w":244.36498164356044,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.628931,"temperature":529,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1132_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#FFE8E7","clouds":false}]}
