  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-243 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-243 is a star with 1.29 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.39 times its radius. It is located 870.39 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-243 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-243 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-243 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-243 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-243 b is 5.342 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-243 b is 2.170 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-243 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-243 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-243 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-243 c is 4.706 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-243 c is 2.010 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.18, and a semi-major axis of 0.1817 astronomical units, K2-243 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
