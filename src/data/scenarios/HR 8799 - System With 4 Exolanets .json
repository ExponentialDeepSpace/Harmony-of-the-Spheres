It is located 134.52 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HR 8799 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HR 8799 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HR 8799 b</h1>\n      <p>HR 8799 b was discovered by the Gemini Observatory observatory, in 2008-11, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 68.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 8799 b is 2226.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 8799 b is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HR 8799 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HR 8799 c</h1>\n      <p>HR 8799 c was discovered by the Gemini Observatory observatory, in 2008-11, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 38.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 8799 c is 3180.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 8799 c is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HR 8799 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HR 8799 d</h1>\n      <p>HR 8799 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2008-11, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 24.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 8799 d is 3180.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 8799 d is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HR 8799 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HR 8799 e</h1>\n      <p>HR 8799 e was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2010-12, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 16.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 8799 e is 3180.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 8799 e is 13.115 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HR 8799 e is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
