{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The TOI-2257 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-2257 is a star with 0.33 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.31 times its radius. It is located 188.49 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-2257 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-2257 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-2257 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-2257 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-2257 b is 5.438 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-2257 b is 2.194 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-2257 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202308,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TOI-2257","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TOI-2257","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"TOI-2257","barycenterMassTwo":"TOI-2257","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":913500,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-2257","m":0.33,"radius":3027.906976744186,"temperature":3430,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-2257-b","texture":"TOI-2257-b","m":0.000016318530000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":191.4418604651163,"a":0.145,"e":0.496,"w":-101.674,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":35.189346,"temperature":256,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#4661E7","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system TOI-2257, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","name":"TOI-2257 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"TOI-2257 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
