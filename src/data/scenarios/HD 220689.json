It is located 153.10 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.586 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 220689 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 220689 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 220689 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 220689 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 220689 b is 355.52400000000006 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 220689 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 220689, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 220689","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 220689","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_220689_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 220689","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 220689","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":21394800,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 220689","m":1.02,"radius":10451.162790697676,"temperature":5921,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 220689-b","texture":"HD 220689-b","m":0.0010669074,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":55.15616477068938,"a":3.396,"e":0.054,"w":112.834,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2266.4,"temperature":132.4999492489194,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_220689_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#07D5D9","clouds":false}]}
