It is located 893.02 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-54 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-54 d</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-54 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 21.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-54.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-54 d is 2.65 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-54 d is 1.53 that of Earth.  At 2.65 Earth masses, Kepler-54 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
