  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 219134 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 219134 is a star with 0.81 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.78 times its radius. It is located 21.30 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 11 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 219134 is known to have 6 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 219134 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 219134 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 219134 b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2015-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 b is 4.741 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 b is 1.602 that of Earth.  At 4.741 Earth masses, HD 219134 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 219134 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 219134 c was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2015-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 c is 4.363 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 c is 1.511 that of Earth.  At 4.363 Earth masses, HD 219134 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 219134 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 219134 d was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2015-12, using the radial velocity method.

The radius of HD 219134 d is 1.610 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 219134 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 219134 f</h1>\n      <p>HD 219134 f was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2015-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 f is 7.304 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 f is 1.310 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 219134 f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 219134 g</h1>\n      <p>HD 219134 g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2015-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.38 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 g is 10.812 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 g is 3.280 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 219134 g is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 219134 h</h1>\n      <p>HD 219134 h was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2015-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 h is 108.120 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 h is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 219134 h is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
