It is located 510.95598959999995 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-538 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-538 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-538 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-538 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-538 b is 10.6 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-538 b is 2.215 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-538 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-538, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-538","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-538","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-538_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-538","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-538","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":2941470,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-538","m":0.89,"radius":8497.67441860465,"temperature":5547,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-538-b","texture":"Kepler-538-b","m":0.000031825905,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":193.39534883720933,"a":0.4669,"e":0.041,"w":140,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":81.73778,"temperature":380,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-538_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#AF84B8","clouds":false}]}
