  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The KOI-94 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>KOI-94 is a star with 1.28 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.52 times its radius. It is located 1555.93 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.16 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>KOI-94 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the KOI-94 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>KOI-94 b</h1>\n      <p>KOI-94 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 b is 10.494 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 b is 1.710 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-94 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KOI-94 c</h1>\n      <p>KOI-94 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 c is 15.582 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 c is 4.320 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-94 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KOI-94 d</h1>\n      <p>KOI-94 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 d is 106.212 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 d is 11.270 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, KOI-94 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KOI-94 e</h1>\n      <p>KOI-94 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.30 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 e is 34.980 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 e is 6.560 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-94 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
