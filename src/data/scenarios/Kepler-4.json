It is located 1793.858 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-4 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-4 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-4 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-4 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-4 b is 24.472 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-4 b is 4.002 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-4 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-4, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-4","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-4","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-4_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-4","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-4","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":287280,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-4","m":1.22,"radius":14553.488372093023,"temperature":5857,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-4-b","texture":"Kepler-4-b","m":0.0000734811,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":348.69767441860466,"a":0.0456,"e":0,"w":286.2579386237634,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.21346,"temperature":1650,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-4_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FDD86E","clouds":false}]}
