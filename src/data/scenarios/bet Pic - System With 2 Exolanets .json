  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The bet Pic Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>bet Pic is a star with 1.76 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.54 times its radius. It is located 64.40 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.012 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>bet Pic is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the bet Pic system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>bet Pic b</h1>\n      <p>bet Pic b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory, in 2009-01, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 9.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of bet Pic b is 3498.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of bet Pic b is 18.495 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, bet Pic b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>bet Pic c</h1>\n      <p>bet Pic c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of bet Pic c is 2862.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of bet Pic c is 12.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, bet Pic c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
