It is located 398.97 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9.15 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 56640 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 56640 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 56640 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 56640 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.73 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 56640 b is 1167.060 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 56640 b is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 56640 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
