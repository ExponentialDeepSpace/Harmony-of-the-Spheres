It is located 2002.60 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-9 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-9 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-9 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-9 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-9 b is 43.4229 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-9 b is 8.29 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-9 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-9 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-9 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-9 c is 29.91744 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-9 c is 8.08 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-9 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-9 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-9 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.  The radius of Kepler-9 d is 1.64 that of Earth.     </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
