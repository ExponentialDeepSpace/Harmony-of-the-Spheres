{"name":"K2-315","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-315 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-315 is a star with 0.17 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.2 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>K2-315 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-315 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-315 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-315 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-315 b is 0.8077200000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-315 b is 0.95 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, K2-315 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-315, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-315","m":0.17,"radius":1953.4883720930234,"temperature":3300,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-315-b","texture":"K2-315-b","m":0.0000024239220000000004,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":83.0232558139535,"a":null,"e":0,"w":288.97547791125817,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.1443189,"temperature":460,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#604E61","clouds":false}]}
