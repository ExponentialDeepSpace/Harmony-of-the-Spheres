  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The LTT 3780 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>LTT 3780 is a star with 0.4 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.37 times its radius. It is located 71.69 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>LTT 3780 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LTT 3780 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LTT 3780 b</h1>\n      <p>LTT 3780 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LTT 3780 b is 2.620 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 3780 b is 1.332 that of Earth.  At 2.620 Earth masses, LTT 3780 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>LTT 3780 c</h1>\n      <p>LTT 3780 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LTT 3780 c is 8.605 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 3780 c is 2.300 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, LTT 3780 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
