The mass of Lupus-TR-3 b is 257.431 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Lupus-TR-3 b is 9.976 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Lupus-TR-3 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, Lupus-TR-3 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Lupus-TR-3, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Lupus-TR-3","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Lupus-TR-3","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Lupus-TR-3","barycenterMassTwo":"Lupus-TR-3","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":292320,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Lupus-TR-3","m":0.87,"radius":8009.302325581395,"temperature":5000,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Lupus-TR-3-b","texture":"Lupus-TR-3-b","m":0.0007729830000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":869.3023255813954,"a":0.0464,"e":0,"w":31.56669404044048,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.91405,"temperature":1006.0738781885287,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#5A9059","clouds":false}]}
