  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 1132 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 1132 is a star with 0.18 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.21 times its radius. It is located 41.14 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 1132 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 1132 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 1132 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1132 b was discovered by the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory observatory, in 2015-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1132 b is 1.660 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1132 b is 1.130 that of Earth.  At 1.660 Earth masses, GJ 1132 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 1132 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1132 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1132 c is 2.643 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1132 c is 1.430 that of Earth.  At 2.643 Earth masses, GJ 1132 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
