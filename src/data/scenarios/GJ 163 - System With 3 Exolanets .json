  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 163 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 163 is a star with 0.4 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.41 times its radius. It is located 49.34 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 163 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 163 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 163 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 163 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 163 b is 10.605 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 163 b is 3.250 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 163 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 163 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 163 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 163 c is 6.805 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 163 c is 2.500 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 163 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 163 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 163 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 163 d is 29.415 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 163 d is 5.920 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 163 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
