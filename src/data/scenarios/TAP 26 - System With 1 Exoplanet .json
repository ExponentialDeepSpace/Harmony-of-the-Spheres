  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TAP 26 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TAP 26 is a star with 1.04 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.17 times its radius. It is located 395.96 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.017 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TAP 26 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TAP 26 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TAP 26 b</h1>\n      <p>TAP 26 b was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory, in 2017-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TAP 26 b is 527.880 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TAP 26 b is 13.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TAP 26 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
