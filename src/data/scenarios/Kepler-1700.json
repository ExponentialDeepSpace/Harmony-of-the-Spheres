{"name":"Kepler-1700","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The Kepler-1700 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-1700 is a star with 1.12 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.09 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1700 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1700 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1700 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1700 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.76 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1700 b is 8.7768 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1700 b is 2.901 that of Earth.  At 8.7768 Earth masses, Kepler-1700 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-1700, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":4772880,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-1700","m":1.12,"radius":10646.511627906977,"temperature":6031,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-1700-b","texture":"Kepler-1700-b","m":0.00002633868,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":252.97674418604655,"a":0.7576,"e":0,"w":14.660763152755907,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":234.239,"temperature":329,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FAC85E","clouds":false}]}
