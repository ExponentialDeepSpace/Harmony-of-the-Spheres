  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-271 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-271 is a star with 0.9 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.87 times its radius. It is located 1319.44 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.57 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-271 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-271 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-271 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-271 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-271 b is 2.042 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-271 b is 1.230 that of Earth.  At 2.042 Earth masses, Kepler-271 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-271 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-271 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-271 c is 0.808 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-271 c is 0.950 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-271 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-271 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-271 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-271 d is 0.219 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-271 d is 0.660 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-271 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
