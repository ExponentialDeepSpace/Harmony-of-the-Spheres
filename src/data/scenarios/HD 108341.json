It is located 161.12 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 108341 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 108341 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 108341 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 108341 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 108341 b is 1113 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 108341 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 108341, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 108341","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 108341","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_108341_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 108341","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 108341","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":12600000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 108341","m":0.84,"radius":7716.279069767443,"temperature":5122,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 108341-b","texture":"HD 108341-b","m":0.0033400500000000002,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":89.07525646696645,"a":2,"e":0.85,"w":190,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1129,"temperature":149.26015579913172,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_108341_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#135C9E","clouds":false}]}
