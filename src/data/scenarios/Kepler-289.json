{"name":"Kepler-289","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The Kepler-289 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-289 is a star with 1.08 times the mass of the Sun, and 1 times its radius. It is located 2283.09 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.65 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-289 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-289 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-289 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-289 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-289 b is 7.314 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-289 b is 2.15 that of Earth.  At 7.314 Earth masses, Kepler-289 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-289 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-289 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.51 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-289 c is 133.56 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-289 c is 11.59 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-289 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-289 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-289 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.33 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-289 d is 4.1339999999999995 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-289 d is 2.68 that of Earth.  At 4.1339999999999995 Earth masses, Kepler-289 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-289, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-289","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-289","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-289","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-289","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":3213000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-289","m":1.08,"radius":9767.441860465116,"temperature":5990,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-289-d","texture":"Kepler-289-d","m":0.0000124059,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":233.4418604651163,"a":0.33,"e":0,"w":239.728171715398,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":66.0634,"temperature":443.6702113722957,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#6342F5","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-289-c","texture":"Kepler-289-c","m":0.000400806,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1009.9534883720931,"a":0.51,"e":0,"w":12.838191680502362,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":125.8518,"temperature":356.8881700815366,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#20FC79","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-289-b","texture":"Kepler-289-b","m":0.0000219489,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":187.53488372093025,"a":0.21,"e":0,"w":328.76893079943443,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":34.545,"temperature":556.1700435055185,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#000B6E","clouds":false}]}
