It is located 2283.0919999999996 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.65 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-289 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-289 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-289 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-289 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-289 b is 7.3 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-289 b is 2.15 that of Earth.  At 7.3 Earth masses, Kepler-289 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-289 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-289 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-289 c is 132 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-289 c is 11.59 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-289 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-289 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-289 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-289 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-289 d is 4 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-289 d is 2.68 that of Earth.  At 4 Earth masses, Kepler-289 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-289, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-289","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-289","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-289","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-289","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":3213000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-289","m":1.08,"radius":9767.441860465116,"temperature":5990,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-289-d","texture":"Kepler-289-d","m":0.0000124059,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":233.4418604651163,"a":0.33,"e":0,"w":120.67640699514942,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":66.0634,"temperature":443.6702113722957,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#0F511A","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-289-c","texture":"Kepler-289-c","m":0.000400806,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1009.9534883720931,"a":0.51,"e":0,"w":88.62807673794268,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":125.8518,"temperature":356.8881700815366,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#00C6C8","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-289-b","texture":"Kepler-289-b","m":0.0000219489,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":187.53488372093025,"a":0.21,"e":0,"w":16.021634115615857,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":34.545,"temperature":556.1700435055185,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-289_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#F0E5B5","clouds":false}]}
