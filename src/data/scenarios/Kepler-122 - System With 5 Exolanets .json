At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-122 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-122 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-122 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-122 d is 5.470 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-122 d is 2.200 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-122 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-122 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-122 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-122 e is 27.666 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-122 e is 2.600 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-122 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-122 f</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-122 f was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-05, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.29 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-122 f is 35.934 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-122 f is 1.750 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-122 f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
