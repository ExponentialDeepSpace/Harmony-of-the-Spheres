  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 114783 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 114783 is a star with 0.85 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.84 times its radius. It is located 68.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 114783 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 114783 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 114783 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 114783 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2002-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 114783 b is 349.800 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 114783 b is 13.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 114783 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 114783 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 114783 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2016-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 4.97 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 114783 c is 194.298 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 114783 c is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 114783 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
