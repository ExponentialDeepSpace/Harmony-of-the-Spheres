It is located 154.24 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 3167 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 3167 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 3167 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 3167 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 3167 b is 5.021 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 3167 b is 1.700 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 3167 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 3167 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 3167 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 3167 c is 9.804 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 3167 c is 2.860 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 3167 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 3167 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 3167 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2017-09, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 3167 d is 6.904 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 3167 d is 2.520 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 3167 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
