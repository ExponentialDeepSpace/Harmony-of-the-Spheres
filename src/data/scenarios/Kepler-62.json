It is located 1200.25 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-62 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-62 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-62 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-62 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 b is 9.54 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 b is 1.31 that of Earth.  At 9.54 Earth masses, Kepler-62 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-62 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-62 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 c is 4.1339999999999995 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 c is 0.54 that of Earth.  At 4.1339999999999995 Earth masses, Kepler-62 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-62 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-62 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 d is 13.991999999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 d is 1.95 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-62 e</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-62 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.43 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 e is 35.934 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 e is 1.61 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-62 f</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-62 f was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.72 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 f is 34.98 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 f is 1.41 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
