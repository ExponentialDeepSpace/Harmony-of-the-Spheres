  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-416 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-416 is a star with 1 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.07 times its radius. It is located 2253.15 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-416 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-416 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-416 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-416 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-05, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-416 b is 58.194 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-416 b is 2.480 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-416 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-416 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-416 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-05, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-416 c is 6.583 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-416 c is 2.450 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-416 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
