It is located 27.76 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8.96 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>61 Vir is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the 61 Vir system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>61 Vir b</h1>\n            <p>61 Vir b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 61 Vir b is 5.088 times the mass of Earth.   At 5.088 Earth masses, 61 Vir b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>61 Vir c</h1>\n            <p>61 Vir c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.22 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 61 Vir c is 18.126 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, 61 Vir c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>61 Vir d</h1>\n            <p>61 Vir d was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.48 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 61 Vir d is 22.895999999999997 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, 61 Vir d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
