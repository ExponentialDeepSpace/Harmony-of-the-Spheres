It is located 750.16 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>PSR J2322-2650 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">PSR J2322-2650 b</h2>\n            <p>PSR J2322-2650 b was discovered by the Parkes Observatory observatory using the pulsar timing method.  Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 0.32 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, PSR J2322-2650.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.0017, which means that when PSR J2322-2650 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.01 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.01. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of PSR J2322-2650 b is 252.63 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, PSR J2322-2650 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
