  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 876 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 876 is a star with 0.32 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.3 times its radius. It is located 15.25 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 876 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 876 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 876 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 876 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 1998-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 876 b is 723.641 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 876 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 876 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 876 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 876 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2001-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 876 c is 227.116 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 876 c is 14.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 876 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 876 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 876 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2005-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 876 d is 6.678 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 876 d is 2.510 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 876 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 876 e</h1>\n      <p>GJ 876 e was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2010-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.33 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 876 e is 14.628 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 876 e is 3.920 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 876 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
