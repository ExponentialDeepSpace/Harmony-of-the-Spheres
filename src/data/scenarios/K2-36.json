It is located 359.07 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>K2-36 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-36 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>K2-36 b</h1>\n            <p>K2-36 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-36 b is 3.90186 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-36 b is 1.43 that of Earth.  At 3.90186 Earth masses, K2-36 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>K2-36 c</h1>\n            <p>K2-36 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-36 c is 7.80372 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-36 c is 3.2 that of Earth.  At 7.80372 Earth masses, K2-36 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
