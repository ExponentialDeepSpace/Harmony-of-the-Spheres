It is located 391.38719999999995 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>WASP-76 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-76 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>WASP-76 b</h1>\n            <p>WASP-76 b was discovered by the SuperWASP observatory using the Transit method. The mass of WASP-76 b is 292.4036 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-76 b is 20.512 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-76 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-76 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-76, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by SuperWASP.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-76","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-76","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-76_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-76","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-76","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":207900,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-76","m":1.46,"radius":16897.674418604653,"temperature":6250,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-76-b","texture":"WASP-76-b","m":0.000877956,"discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1787.4418604651164,"a":0.033,"e":0,"w":186.09002243188036,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.809886,"temperature":2160,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-76_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#D3143A","clouds":false}]}
