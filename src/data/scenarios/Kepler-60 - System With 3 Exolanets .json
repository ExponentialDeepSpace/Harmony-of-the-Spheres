  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-60 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-60 is a star with 1.04 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.26 times its radius. It is located 3343.43 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-60 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-60 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-60 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-60 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-60 b is 4.191 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-60 b is 1.710 that of Earth.  At 4.191 Earth masses, Kepler-60 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-60 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-60 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-60 c is 3.851 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-60 c is 1.900 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.06, and a semi-major axis of 0.0835 astronomical units, Kepler-60 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-60 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-60 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-60 d is 4.163 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-60 d is 1.990 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.91, and a semi-major axis of 0.1012 astronomical units, Kepler-60 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
