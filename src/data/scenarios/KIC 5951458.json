Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KIC 5951458 b is 35.298 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KIC 5951458 b is 6.6 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, KIC 5951458 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KIC 5951458, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KIC 5951458","m":0.98,"radius":14846.511627906977,"temperature":6258,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KIC 5951458-b","texture":"KIC 5951458-b","m":0.00010592730000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":575.3023255813954,"a":null,"e":0,"w":218.56928233699026,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1320.1,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#F3907F","clouds":false}]}
