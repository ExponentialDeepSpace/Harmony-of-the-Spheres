Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 20.51 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-48.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-48 b is 6.68 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-48 b is 2.24 that of Earth.  At 6.68 Earth masses, K2-48 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
