  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-783 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-783 is a star with 0.93 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.89 times its radius. It is located 1683.26 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.89 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-783 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-783 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-783 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-783 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-783 b is 0.401 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-783 b is 0.780 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-783 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-783 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-783 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2020-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-783 c is 6.042 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-783 c is 2.332 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-783 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
