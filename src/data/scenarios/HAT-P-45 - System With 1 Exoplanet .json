  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HAT-P-45 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HAT-P-45 is a star with 1.26 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.32 times its radius. It is located 974.03 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HAT-P-45 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HAT-P-45 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HAT-P-45 b</h1>\n      <p>HAT-P-45 b was discovered by the HATNet observatory, in 2014-06, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-45 b is 283.656 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HAT-P-45 b is 15.984 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HAT-P-45 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
