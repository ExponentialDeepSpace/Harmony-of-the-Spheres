{"name":"TOI-763","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The TOI-763 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-763 is a star with 0.92 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.9 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-763 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-763 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-763 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-763 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-763 b is 9.7944 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-763 b is 2.28 that of Earth.  At 9.7944 Earth masses, TOI-763 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-763 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-763 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-763 c is 9.32376 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-763 c is 2.63 that of Earth.  At 9.32376 Earth masses, TOI-763 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system TOI-763, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":636930,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-763","m":0.92,"radius":8790.697674418605,"temperature":5450,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-763-c","texture":"TOI-763-c","m":0.000027980076,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":229.53488372093022,"a":0.1011,"e":0.04,"w":62,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":12.2737,"temperature":800,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B9783D","clouds":false},{"name":"TOI-763-b","texture":"TOI-763-b","m":0.000029392440000000003,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":198.27906976744188,"a":0.06,"e":0.04,"w":42,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.6057,"temperature":1038,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6081D0","clouds":false}]}
