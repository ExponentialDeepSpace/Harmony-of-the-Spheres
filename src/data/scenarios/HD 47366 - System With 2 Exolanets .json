It is located 275.13 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.94 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 47366 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 47366 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 47366 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 47366 b was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory, in 2016-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 47366 b is 731.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 47366 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 47366 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 47366 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 47366 c was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory, in 2016-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.97 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 47366 c is 597.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 47366 c is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 47366 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
