It is located 1956.94 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>PSR B1257+12 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">PSR B1257+12 b</h2>\n            <p>PSR B1257+12 b was discovered by the Arecibo Observatory observatory using the pulsar timing method. Its discovery was announced in 1994-04. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 25.26 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, PSR B1257+12.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0, which means that when PSR B1257+12 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.19 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.19. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of PSR B1257+12 b is 0.02 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, PSR B1257+12 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">PSR B1257+12 c</h2>\n            <p>PSR B1257+12 c was discovered by the Arecibo Observatory observatory using the pulsar timing method. Its discovery was announced in 1992-01. Its semi-major axis is 0.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.

In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of PSR B1257+12 c is 4.30 times the mass of Earth.   At 4.30 Earth masses, PSR B1257+12 c is a so called Super Earth.

No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">PSR B1257+12 d</h2>\n            <p>PSR B1257+12 d was discovered by the Arecibo Observatory observatory using the pulsar timing method.
