It is located 182.23 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 109271 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 109271 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 109271 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 109271 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 109271 b is 17.172 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 109271 b is 4.310 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 109271 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 109271 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 109271 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2013-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 109271 c is 24.168 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 109271 c is 5.270 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 109271 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
