  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-277 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-277 is a star with 1.12 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.69 times its radius. It is located 3185.38 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-277 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-277 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-277 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-277 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-277 b is 87.450 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-277 b is 2.920 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-277 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-277 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-277 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-277 c is 64.236 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-277 c is 3.360 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-277 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
