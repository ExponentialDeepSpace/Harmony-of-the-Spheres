It is located 797.74 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>EPIC 220674823 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the EPIC 220674823 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>EPIC 220674823 b</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 220674823 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 220674823 b is 7.724 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 220674823 b is 1.820 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 220674823 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>EPIC 220674823 c</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 220674823 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 220674823 c is 5.803 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 220674823 c is 2.730 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 220674823 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
