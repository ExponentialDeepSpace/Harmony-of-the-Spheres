{"name":"WASP-88","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The WASP-88 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>WASP-88 is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.8 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>WASP-88 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-88 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>WASP-88 b</h1>\n      <p>WASP-88 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-88 b is 133.56 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-88 b is 16.365 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-88 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-88, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":405153,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-88","m":0.94,"radius":17581.39534883721,"temperature":6430,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-88-b","texture":"WASP-88-b","m":0.000400806,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1426.046511627907,"a":0.06431,"e":0,"w":174.029665129865,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.954,"temperature":1772,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#F3FC62","clouds":false}]}
