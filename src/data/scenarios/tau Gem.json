{"name":"tau Gem","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The tau Gem Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>tau Gem is a star with 2.3 times the mass of the Sun, and 26.8 times its radius. It is located 367.38 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.22 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>tau Gem is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the tau Gem system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>tau Gem b</h1>\n            <p>tau Gem b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Gem b is 6550.8 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, tau Gem b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Lick Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system tau Gem, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Lick Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"tau Gem","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"tau Gem","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/tau_gem_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"tau Gem","barycenterMassTwo":"tau Gem","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":7371000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"tau Gem","m":2.3,"radius":261767.44186046513,"temperature":4388,"massType":"star"},{"name":"tau Gem-b","texture":"tau Gem-b","m":0.019658580000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Lick Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":187.53085573265798,"a":1.17,"e":0.031,"w":137.4,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":305.5,"temperature":415.3864924526423,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/tau_gem_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#9EC48B","clouds":false}]}
