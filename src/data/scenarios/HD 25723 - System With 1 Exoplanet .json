{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HD 25723 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 25723 is a star with 2.12 times the mass of the Sun, and 13.76 times its radius. It is located 374.48 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.95 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 25723 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 25723 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 25723 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 25723 b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory, in 2020-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.49 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 25723 b is 795.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 25723 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 25723 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202308,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 25723","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 25723","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 25723","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 25723","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":9387000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 25723","m":2.12,"radius":134400,"temperature":4766,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 25723-b","texture":"HD 25723-b","m":0.0023857500000000003,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1152.5581395348838,"a":1.49,"e":0.04,"w":112.97,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":457.01,"temperature":346.2646727184426,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6C69F2","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HD 25723, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Lick Observatory.","name":"HD 25723 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HD 25723 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
