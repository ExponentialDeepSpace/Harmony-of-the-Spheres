It is located 59.23 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 3998 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3998 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 3998 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3998 b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3998 b is 2.47086 times the mass of Earth.   At 2.47086 Earth masses, GJ 3998 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 3998 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 3998 c was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3998 c is 6.2646 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.2646 Earth masses, GJ 3998 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
