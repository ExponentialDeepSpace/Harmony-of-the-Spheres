  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-424 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-424 is a star with 1.01 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.94 times its radius. It is located 2278.68 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-424 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-424 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-424 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-424 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-424 b is 327.540 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-424 b is 9.980 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-424 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-424 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-424 c was discovered by the McDonald Observatory observatory, in 2014-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.73 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-424 c is 2216.460 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-424 c is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-424 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
