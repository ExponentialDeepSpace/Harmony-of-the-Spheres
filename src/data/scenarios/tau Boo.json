Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Boo b is 1373.76 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, tau Boo b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Roque de los Muchachos Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system tau Boo, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Roque de los Muchachos Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"tau Boo","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"tau Boo","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/tau_boo_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"tau Boo","barycenterMassTwo":"tau Boo","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":308700,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"tau Boo","m":1.34,"radius":14260.465116279069,"temperature":6400,"massType":"star"},{"name":"tau Boo-b","texture":"tau Boo-b","m":0.004122576,"discoveryFacility":"Roque de los Muchachos Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":97.30870131508178,"a":0.049,"e":0.011,"w":113.4,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.3124568,"temperature":1353.567701063038,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/tau_boo_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#768E1F","clouds":false}]}
