  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 30177 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 30177 is a star with 1.05 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.02 times its radius. It is located 181.30 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.525 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 30177 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 30177 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 30177 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 30177 b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2003-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 30177 b is 2741.796 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 30177 b is 12.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 30177 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 30177 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 30177 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 9.89 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 30177 c is 2416.800 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 30177 c is 12.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 30177 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
