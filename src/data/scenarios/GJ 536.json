Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 536 b is 5.36148 times the mass of Earth.   At 5.36148 Earth masses, GJ 536 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 536, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 536","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 536","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_536_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 536","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 536","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":419643,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 536","m":0.52,"radius":4883.720930232558,"temperature":3685,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 536-b","texture":"GJ 536-b","m":0.000016089498,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":9.473897514153347,"a":0.06661,"e":0.08,"w":288.7,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8.7076,"temperature":570.7977004069412,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_536_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#2AC507","clouds":false}]}
