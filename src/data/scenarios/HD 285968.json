It is located 30.89 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HD 285968 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 285968 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 285968 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 285968 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 285968 b is 8.267999999999999 times the mass of Earth.   At 8.267999999999999 Earth masses, HD 285968 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
