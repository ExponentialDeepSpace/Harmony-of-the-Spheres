It is located 1724.79 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HAT-P-43 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HAT-P-43 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HAT-P-43 b</h1>\n      <p>HAT-P-43 b was discovered by the HATNet observatory, in 2013-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-43 b is 210.516 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HAT-P-43 b is 14.359 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HAT-P-43 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
