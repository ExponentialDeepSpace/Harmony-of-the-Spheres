It is located 12.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Teegarden's Star is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Teegarden's Star system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Teegarden's Star b</h1>\n            <p>Teegarden's Star b was discovered by the Calar Alto Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Teegarden's Star b is 1.0493999999999999 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Teegarden's Star b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Teegarden's Star c</h1>\n            <p>Teegarden's Star c was discovered by the Calar Alto Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Teegarden's Star c is 1.10982 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Teegarden's Star c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    With a mass of 1.10982 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.0443 astronomical units, Teegarden's Star c could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
