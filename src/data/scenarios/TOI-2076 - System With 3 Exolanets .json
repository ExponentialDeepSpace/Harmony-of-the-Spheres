  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-2076 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-2076 is a star with 0.85 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.76 times its radius. It is located 136.69 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.204 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-2076 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-2076 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-2076 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-2076 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-2076 b is 10.812 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-2076 b is 3.282 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-2076 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-2076 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-2076 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-2076 c is 18.031 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-2076 c is 4.438 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-2076 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-2076 d</h1>\n      <p>TOI-2076 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-2076 d is 16.027 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-2076 d is 4.140 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-2076 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
