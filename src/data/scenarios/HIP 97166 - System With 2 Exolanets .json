{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HIP 97166 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 97166 is a star with 0.9 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.84 times its radius. It is located 215.10 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.33 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 97166 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 97166 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 97166 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 97166 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 97166 b is 20.012 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 97166 b is 2.740 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 97166 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 97166 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 97166 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 97166 c is 9.906 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 97166 c is 3.120 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 97166 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"publishDate":202308,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HIP 97166","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HIP 97166","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HIP 97166","barycenterMassTwo":"HIP 97166","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":781200,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 97166","m":0.9,"radius":8204.651162790697,"temperature":5198,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 97166-c","texture":"HIP 97166-c","m":0.000029726445000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":271.5348837209303,"a":0.124,"e":0.25,"w":178.2,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":16.84,"temperature":642,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2FF2EC","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HIP 97166-b","texture":"HIP 97166-b","m":0.000060054099,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":238.32558139534885,"a":0.089,"e":0.16,"w":120.9,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":10.28891,"temperature":757,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#EEDC3F","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HIP 97166, which contains 2 exoplanets and was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","name":"HIP 97166 - System With 2 Exoplanets ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HIP 97166 - System With 2 Exolanets "}
