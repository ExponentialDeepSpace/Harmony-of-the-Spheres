{"name":"HD 181433","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The HD 181433 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>HD 181433 is a star with 0.63 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.79 times its radius. It is located 87.74 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HD 181433 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 181433 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 181433 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 181433 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 181433 b is 6.36 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.36 Earth masses, HD 181433 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 181433 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 181433 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.76 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 181433 c is 203.52 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 181433 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 181433 d</h1>\n            <p>HD 181433 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 181433 d is 171.72 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 181433 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 181433, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 181433","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 181433","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_181433_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 181433","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 181433","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":18900000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 181433","m":0.63,"radius":7716.279069767443,"temperature":4918,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 181433-d","texture":"HD 181433-d","m":0.000515322,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":40.630660461744135,"a":3,"e":0.48,"w":-30,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2172,"temperature":98.2187061082388,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_181433_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#4CAC01","clouds":false},{"name":"HD 181433-c","texture":"HD 181433-c","m":0.000610752,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":43.635915481742494,"a":1.76,"e":0.28,"w":21.4,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":962,"temperature":128.23261597742842,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_181433_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#3AFAA8","clouds":false},{"name":"HD 181433-b","texture":"HD 181433-b","m":0.000019086,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":10.178437190094373,"a":0.08,"e":0.4,"w":357.98033037994,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":9.3743,"temperature":601.4642829039159,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_181433_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#F40574","clouds":false}]}
