  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The ROXs 42 B Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>ROXs 42 B is a star with 1 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.34 times its radius. It is located 468.33 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.003 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>ROXs 42 B is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the ROXs 42 B system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>ROXs 42 B b</h1>\n      <p>ROXs 42 B b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-01, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 157.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of ROXs 42 B b is 2862.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of ROXs 42 B b is 12.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, ROXs 42 B b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
