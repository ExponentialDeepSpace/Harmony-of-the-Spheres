It is located 21526.30 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>OGLE-2005-BLG-390L is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">OGLE-2005-BLG-390L b</h2>\n            <p>OGLE-2005-BLG-390L b was discovered by the OGLE observatory using the microlensing method. Its discovery was announced in 2006-01. Its semi-major axis is 2.60 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 3285.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, OGLE-2005-BLG-390L.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of OGLE-2005-BLG-390L b is 5.40 times the mass of Earth.   At 5.40 Earth masses, OGLE-2005-BLG-390L b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
