Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KELT-15 b is 416.58000000000004 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KELT-15 b is 19.504 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KELT-15 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KELT-15, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":290619,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KELT-15","m":2.06,"radius":17386.04651162791,"temperature":6003,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KELT-15-b","texture":"KELT-15-b","m":0.001250133,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1699.5348837209303,"a":0.04613,"e":0,"w":333.8239951618998,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.32944,"temperature":1642,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#13ECE8","clouds":false}]}
