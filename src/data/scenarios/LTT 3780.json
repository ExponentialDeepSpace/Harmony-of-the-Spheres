Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LTT 3780 b is 2.6203200000000004 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 3780 b is 1.332 that of Earth.  At 2.6203200000000004 Earth masses, LTT 3780 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>LTT 3780 c</h1>\n            <p>LTT 3780 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method.

The radius of LTT 3780 c is 2.3 that of Earth.  At 8.605080000000001 Earth masses, LTT 3780 c is a so called Super Earth.
