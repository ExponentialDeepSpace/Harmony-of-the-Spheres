M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.86 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 98736 b is 740.94 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 98736 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W.
