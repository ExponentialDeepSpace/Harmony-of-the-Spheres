It is located 22.40 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>LTT 1445 A is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LTT 1445 A system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LTT 1445 A b</h1>\n      <p>LTT 1445 A b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LTT 1445 A b is 2.201 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 1445 A b is 1.380 that of Earth.  At 2.201 Earth masses, LTT 1445 A b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
