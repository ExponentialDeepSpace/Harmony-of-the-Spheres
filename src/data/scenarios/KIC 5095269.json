It is located 4013.68 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>KIC 5095269 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">KIC 5095269 b</h2>\n            <p>KIC 5095269 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the eclipse timing variations method. Its discovery was announced in 2017-07. Its semi-major axis is 0.80 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 237.69 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, KIC 5095269.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.0603, which means that when KIC 5095269 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.75 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.85. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of KIC 5095269 b is 2444.92 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, KIC 5095269 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
