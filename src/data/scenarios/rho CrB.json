{"name":"rho CrB","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The rho CrB Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>rho CrB is a star with 0.89 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.36 times its radius. It is located 57.01 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>rho CrB is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the rho CrB system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>rho CrB b</h1>\n            <p>rho CrB b was discovered by the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.22 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of rho CrB b is 332.27819999999997 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, rho CrB b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>rho CrB c</h1>\n            <p>rho CrB c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.41 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of rho CrB c is 25.013879999999997 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, rho CrB c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system rho CrB, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"rho CrB","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"rho CrB","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_143761_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"rho CrB","barycenterMassTwo":"rho CrB","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":2597490,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"rho CrB","m":0.89,"radius":13283.72093023256,"temperature":5627,"massType":"star"},{"name":"rho CrB-c","texture":"rho CrB-c","m":0.000075065238,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":18.091107675684047,"a":0.4123,"e":0.052,"w":190,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":102.54,"temperature":448,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_143761_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2CFDA9","clouds":false},{"name":"rho CrB-b","texture":"rho CrB-b","m":0.00099714807,"discoveryFacility":"Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":53.6117383147181,"a":0.2196,"e":0.0373,"w":270.6,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":39.8458,"temperature":614,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_143761_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B008A7","clouds":false}]}
