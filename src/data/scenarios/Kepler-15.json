It is located 2463.72 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-15 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-15 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-15 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-15 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-15 b is 209.88000000000002 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-15 b is 10.76 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-15 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-15, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-15","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-15","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-15_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-15","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-15","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":359982,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-15","m":1.02,"radius":9669.767441860466,"temperature":5515,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-15-b","texture":"Kepler-15-b","m":0.0006298380000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":937.6744186046512,"a":0.05714,"e":0.06,"w":337.39685341145844,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.942782,"temperature":1021.4789812763555,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-15_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A82D9F","clouds":false}]}
