  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The LTT 9779 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>LTT 9779 is a star with 0.77 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.95 times its radius. It is located 261.80 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>LTT 9779 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LTT 9779 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LTT 9779 b</h1>\n      <p>LTT 9779 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LTT 9779 b is 29.335 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LTT 9779 b is 4.720 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, LTT 9779 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
