  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 156279 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 156279 is a star with 0.95 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.95 times its radius. It is located 118.05 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 156279 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 156279 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 156279 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 156279 b was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2012-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.49 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 156279 b is 3141.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 156279 b is 12.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 156279 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 156279 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 156279 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2016-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.46 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 156279 c is 2734.800 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 156279 c is 12.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 156279 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
