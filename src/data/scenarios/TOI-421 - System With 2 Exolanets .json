  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-421 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-421 is a star with 0.85 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.87 times its radius. It is located 243.95 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9.4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-421 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-421 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-421 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-421 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-421 b is 7.174 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-421 b is 2.680 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-421 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-421 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-421 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-421 c is 16.428 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-421 c is 5.090 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-421 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
