{"name":"K2-165","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-165 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-165 is a star with 0.83 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.8 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-165 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-165 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-165 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-165 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-165 b is 2.16876 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-165 b is 1.274 that of Earth.  At 2.16876 Earth masses, K2-165 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-165 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-165 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-165 c is 3.0368999999999997 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-165 c is 1.554 that of Earth.  At 3.0368999999999997 Earth masses, K2-165 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-165 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-165 d was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-165 d is 7.5047999999999995 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-165 d is 2.648 that of Earth.  At 7.5047999999999995 Earth masses, K2-165 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
