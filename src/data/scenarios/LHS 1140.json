It is located 48.890784399999994 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>LHS 1140 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the LHS 1140 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>LHS 1140 c</h1>\n            <p>LHS 1140 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the Transit method. The mass of LHS 1140 c is 1.81 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LHS 1140 c is 1.282 that of Earth.  At 1.81 Earth masses, LHS 1140 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>LHS 1140 b</h1>\n            <p>LHS 1140 b was discovered by the MEarth Project observatory using the Transit method. The mass of LHS 1140 b is 6.98 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LHS 1140 b is 1.727 that of Earth.  At 6.98 Earth masses, LHS 1140 b is a so called Super Earth.
