{"name":"Kepler-1649","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The Kepler-1649 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-1649 is a star with 0.2 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.23 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1649 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1649 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1649 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1649 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1649 b is 1.0334999999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1649 b is 1.017 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1649 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-1649 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1649 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1649 c is 1.19886 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1649 c is 1.06 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1649 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    With a mass of 1.19886 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.0649 astronomical units, Kepler-1649 c could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-1649, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":408870,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-1649","m":0.2,"radius":2246.511627906977,"temperature":3240,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-1649-c","texture":"Kepler-1649-c","m":0.000003597711,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":92.79069767441861,"a":0.0649,"e":0,"w":341.4632545252788,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":19.53527,"temperature":234,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#7DF5C0","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-1649-b","texture":"Kepler-1649-b","m":0.000003101475,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":88.88372093023256,"a":0.0514,"e":0,"w":293.8182862388248,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8.689099,"temperature":307,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#5FDACB","clouds":false}]}
