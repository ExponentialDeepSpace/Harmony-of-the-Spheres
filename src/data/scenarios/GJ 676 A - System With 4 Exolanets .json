  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 676 A Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 676 A is a star with 0.73 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.69 times its radius. It is located 52.27 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 676 A is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 676 A system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 676 A b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 676 A b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2011-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.82 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 676 A b is 2130.600 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 676 A b is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 676 A b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 676 A c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 676 A c was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory, in 2016-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 6.60 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 676 A c is 2162.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 676 A c is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 676 A c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 676 A d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 676 A d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2012-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 676 A d is 4.452 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 676 A d is 1.930 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.36, and a semi-major axis of 0.0413 astronomical units, GJ 676 A d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 676 A e</h1>\n      <p>GJ 676 A e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2012-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 676 A e is 7.950 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 676 A e is 2.770 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 676 A e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
