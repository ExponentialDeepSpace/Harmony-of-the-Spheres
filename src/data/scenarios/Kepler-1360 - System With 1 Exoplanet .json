It is located 4945.41 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.55 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1360 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1360 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1360 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1360 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.29 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1360 b is 11.480 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1360 b is 3.400 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-1360 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
