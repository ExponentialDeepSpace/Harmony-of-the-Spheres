  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-220 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-220 is a star with 0.65 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.67 times its radius. It is located 558.08 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-220 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-220 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-220 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-220 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-220 b is 0.458 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-220 b is 0.810 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-220 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-220 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-220 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-220 c is 3.091 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-220 c is 1.570 that of Earth.  At 3.091 Earth masses, Kepler-220 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-220 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-220 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-220 d is 0.903 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-220 d is 0.980 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-220 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-220 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-220 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-220 e is 2.331 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-220 e is 1.330 that of Earth.  At 2.331 Earth masses, Kepler-220 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
