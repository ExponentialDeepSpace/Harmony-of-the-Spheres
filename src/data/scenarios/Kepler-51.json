The mass of Kepler-51 b is 2.1 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-51 b is 7.1 that of Earth.  At 2.1 Earth masses, Kepler-51 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-51 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-51 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-51 c is 4 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-51 c is 9 that of Earth.  At 4 Earth masses, Kepler-51 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
