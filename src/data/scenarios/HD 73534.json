It is located 272.44 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>HD 73534 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">HD 73534 b</h2>\n            <p>HD 73534 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its discovery was announced in 2009-09. Its semi-major axis is 2.99 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 1750.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, HD 73534.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.126, which means that when HD 73534 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 2.61 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 3.37. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of HD 73534 b is 353.41 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 73534 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
