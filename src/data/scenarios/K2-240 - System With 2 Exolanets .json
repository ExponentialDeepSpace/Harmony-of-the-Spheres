  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-240 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-240 is a star with 0.58 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.54 times its radius. It is located 237.80 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-240 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-240 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-240 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-240 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-240 b is 4.675 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-240 b is 2.000 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.2, and a semi-major axis of 0.0513 astronomical units, K2-240 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-240 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-240 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-240 c is 3.911 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-240 c is 1.800 that of Earth.  At 3.911 Earth masses, K2-240 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
