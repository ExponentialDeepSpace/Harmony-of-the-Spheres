  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The tau Boo Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>tau Boo is a star with 1.32 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.43 times its radius. It is located 51.05 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>tau Boo is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the tau Boo system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>tau Boo b</h1>\n      <p>tau Boo b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2015-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Boo b is 1892.100 times the mass of Earth. The radius of tau Boo b is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, tau Boo b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
