  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 68988 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 68988 is a star with 1.28 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.19 times its radius. It is located 198.45 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 68988 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 68988 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 68988 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 68988 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2002-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 68988 b is 626.460 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 68988 b is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 68988 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 68988 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 68988 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 13.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 68988 c is 4770.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 68988 c is 12.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 68988 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
