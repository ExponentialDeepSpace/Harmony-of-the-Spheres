It is located 4762.20 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.29 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1154 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1154 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1154 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1154 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1154 b is 6.074 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1154 b is 2.340 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-1154 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-1154 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1154 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1154 c is 6.169 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1154 c is 2.360 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-1154 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
