Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-424 b is 327.54 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-424 b is 9.98 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-424 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-424 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-424 c was discovered by the McDonald Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.73 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-424 c is 2216.46 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-424 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-424, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-424","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-424","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-424_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-424","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-424","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":4599000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-424","m":1.01,"radius":9181.395348837208,"temperature":5460,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-424-c","texture":"Kepler-424-c","m":0.006651471,"discoveryFacility":"McDonald Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":118.96145562692662,"a":0.73,"e":0,"w":287.6445858657918,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":223.3,"temperature":283.6801998201274,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-424_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#AB79F8","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-424-b","texture":"Kepler-424-b","m":0.000982929,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":869.3023255813954,"a":0.044,"e":0,"w":117.8845792425322,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.3118644,"temperature":1155.4844783986698,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-424_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#BAEEE8","clouds":false}]}
