It is located 237.41 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.22 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 203473 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 203473 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 203473 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 203473 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.73 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 203473 b is 2480.4 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 203473 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W.
