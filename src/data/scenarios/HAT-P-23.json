{"name":"HAT-P-23","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HAT-P-23 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HAT-P-23 is a star with 0.58 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.96 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HAT-P-23 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HAT-P-23 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HAT-P-23 b</h1>\n      <p>HAT-P-23 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-23 b is 426.12 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HAT-P-23 b is 12.218 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, HAT-P-23 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HAT-P-23, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":146160,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HAT-P-23","m":0.58,"radius":9376.744186046511,"temperature":5905,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HAT-P-23-b","texture":"HAT-P-23-b","m":0.0012787620000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1064.6511627906978,"a":0.0232,"e":0.11,"w":121,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.21288,"temperature":1951,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#1C3EA6","clouds":false}]}
