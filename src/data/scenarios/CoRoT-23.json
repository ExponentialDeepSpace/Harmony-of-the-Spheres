It is located 1956.94 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>CoRoT-23 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the CoRoT-23 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>CoRoT-23 b</h1>\n            <p>CoRoT-23 b was discovered by the CoRoT observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of CoRoT-23 b is 890.4 times the mass of Earth. The radius of CoRoT-23 b is 11.77 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, CoRoT-23 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"CoRoT","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system CoRoT-23, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by CoRoT.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"CoRoT-23","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"CoRoT-23","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/corot-23_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"CoRoT-23","barycenterMassTwo":"CoRoT-23","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":302400,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"CoRoT-23","m":1.14,"radius":15725.581395348838,"temperature":5900,"massType":"star"},{"name":"CoRoT-23-b","texture":"CoRoT-23-b","m":0.00267204,"discoveryFacility":"CoRoT","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1025.5813953488373,"a":0.048,"e":0.16,"w":52,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.6313,"temperature":1660,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/corot-23_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#4230D3","clouds":false}]}
