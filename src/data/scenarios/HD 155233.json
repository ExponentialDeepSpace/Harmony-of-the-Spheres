Its semi-major axis is 2.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 155233 b is 826.8000000000001 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 155233 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Anglo-Australian Telescope","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 155233, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Anglo-Australian Telescope.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 155233","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 155233","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_155233_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 155233","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 155233","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":12600000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 155233","m":1.69,"radius":49130.232558139534,"temperature":4960,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 155233-b","texture":"HD 155233-b","m":0.0024811800000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Anglo-Australian Telescope","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":78.62077290620927,"a":2,"e":0.04,"w":120,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":818.8,"temperature":252.1444739537935,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_155233_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#3A331F","clouds":false}]}
