  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The alf Tau Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>alf Tau is a star with 1.13 times the mass of the Sun, and 45.1 times its radius. It is located 66.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>alf Tau is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the alf Tau system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>alf Tau b</h1>\n      <p>alf Tau b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2015-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.46 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of alf Tau b is 2057.460 times the mass of Earth. The radius of alf Tau b is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, alf Tau b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
