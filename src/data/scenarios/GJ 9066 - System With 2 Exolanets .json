It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 9066 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 9066 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 9066 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 9066 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2020-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 9066 b is 30.916 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9066 b is 6.100 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 9066 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 9066 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 9066 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2020-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.87 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 9066 c is 71.639 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9066 c is 10.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 9066 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
