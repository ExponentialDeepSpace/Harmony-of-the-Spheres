{"name":"NY Vir","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The NY Vir Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>NY Vir is a star with 0.46 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.15 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>NY Vir is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the NY Vir system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>NY Vir b</h1>\n      <p>NY Vir b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the eclipse timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 3.30 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of NY Vir b is 731.4 times the mass of Earth. The radius of NY Vir b is 13.3 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, NY Vir b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>NY Vir c</h1>\n      <p>NY Vir c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the eclipse timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of NY Vir c is 1761.72 times the mass of Earth. The radius of NY Vir c is 12.8 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, NY Vir c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system NY Vir, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"NY Vir","m":0.46,"radius":1465.1162790697674,"temperature":32780,"massType":"star"},{"name":"NY Vir-c","texture":"NY Vir-c","m":0.005286822,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1113.4883720930231,"a":null,"e":0.15,"w":320,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8799,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#EF9E21","clouds":false},{"name":"NY Vir-b","texture":"NY Vir-b","m":0.00219489,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1162.3255813953488,"a":3.3,"e":0.15,"w":348,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3160,"temperature":73.97088721565521,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#11014C","clouds":false}]}
