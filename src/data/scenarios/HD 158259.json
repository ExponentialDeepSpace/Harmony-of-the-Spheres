It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 158259 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 158259 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 158259 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 158259 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 158259 b is 2.21964 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 158259 b is 1.358 that of Earth.  At 2.21964 Earth masses, HD 158259 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 158259 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 158259 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method.
