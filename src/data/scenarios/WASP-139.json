It is located 750.1587999999999 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>WASP-139 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-139 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>WASP-139 b</h1>\n            <p>WASP-139 b was discovered by the SuperWASP-South observatory using the Transit method. The mass of WASP-139 b is 37.18611 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-139 b is 8.967 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-139 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP-South","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-139, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by SuperWASP-South.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-139","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-139","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-139_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-139","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-139","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":390600,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-139","m":0.92,"radius":7813.9534883720935,"temperature":5310,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-139-b","texture":"WASP-139-b","m":0.00011165310000000002,"discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP-South","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":781.3953488372094,"a":0.062,"e":0,"w":199.24735884670702,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.924262,"temperature":910,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-139_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6C3EEC","clouds":false}]}
