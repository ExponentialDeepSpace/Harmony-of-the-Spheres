Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Gl 49 b is 5.63178 times the mass of Earth.   At 5.63178 Earth masses, Gl 49 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Gl 49, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Gl 49","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Gl 49","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gliese_49_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Gl 49","barycenterMassTwo":"Gl 49","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":570150,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Gl 49","m":0.52,"radius":4981.39534883721,"temperature":3805,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Gl 49-b","texture":"Gl 49-b","m":0.000016900653,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":9.671643914595954,"a":0.0905,"e":0.363,"w":43,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":13.8508,"temperature":489.69722391152334,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gliese_49_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#0EA64B","clouds":false}]}
