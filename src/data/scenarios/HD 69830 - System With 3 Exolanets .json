It is located 40.96 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 69830 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 69830 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 69830 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 69830 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2006-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 69830 b is 10.208 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 69830 b is 3.170 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 69830 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 69830 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 69830 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2006-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 69830 c is 11.798 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 69830 c is 3.460 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 69830 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 69830 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 69830 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2006-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.63 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 69830 d is 18.126 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 69830 d is 4.450 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 69830 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
