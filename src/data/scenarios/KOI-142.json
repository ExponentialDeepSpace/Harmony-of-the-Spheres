{"name":"KOI-142","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The KOI-142 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>KOI-142 is a star with 0.99 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.9 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>KOI-142 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the KOI-142 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>KOI-142 b</h1>\n      <p>KOI-142 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-142 b is 9.54 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-142 b is 3.438 that of Earth.  At 9.54 Earth masses, KOI-142 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KOI-142 c</h1>\n      <p>KOI-142 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-142 c is 214.33200000000002 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-142 c is 14 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KOI-142 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KOI-142 d</h1>\n      <p>KOI-142 d was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-142 d is 970.04628 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-142 d is 13.1 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KOI-142 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KOI-142, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KOI-142","m":0.99,"radius":8790.697674418605,"temperature":5466,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KOI-142-d","texture":"KOI-142-d","m":0.0029110539780000002,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1142.7906976744187,"a":null,"e":0.41,"w":160.44805638288648,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1403,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#5615A0","clouds":false},{"name":"KOI-142-c","texture":"KOI-142-c","m":0.0006431982000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1220.9302325581396,"a":0.15525,"e":0.05724,"w":270.76,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":22.26492,"temperature":605.9824064249121,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#61A4F3","clouds":false},{"name":"KOI-142-b","texture":"KOI-142-b","m":0.000028629,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":299.8604651162791,"a":0.098,"e":0.05561,"w":90.59,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":10.91647,"temperature":758,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A2759D","clouds":false}]}
