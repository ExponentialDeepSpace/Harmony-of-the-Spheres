At less than 1.5 Earth masses, K2-19 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">K2-19 b</h2>\n            <p>K2-19 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2015-08. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 7.92 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-19.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-19 b is 130.89 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-19 b is 7.74 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, K2-19 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">K2-19 c</h2>\n            <p>K2-19 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2015-08. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.
