It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HU Aqr is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HU Aqr system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HU Aqr b</h1>\n      <p>HU Aqr b was discovered by the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory observatory, in 2011-06, using the eclipse timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 3.60 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HU Aqr b is 1876.200 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HU Aqr b is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HU Aqr b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HU Aqr c</h1>\n      <p>HU Aqr c was discovered by the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory observatory, in 2011-06, using the eclipse timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 5.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HU Aqr c is 1431.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HU Aqr c is 12.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HU Aqr c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
