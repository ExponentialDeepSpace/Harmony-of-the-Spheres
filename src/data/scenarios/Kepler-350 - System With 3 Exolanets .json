  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-350 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-350 is a star with 1.19 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.53 times its radius. It is located 3120.85 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-350 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-350 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-350 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-350 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-350 b is 4.070 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-350 b is 1.850 that of Earth.  At 4.070 Earth masses, Kepler-350 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-350 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-350 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-350 c is 6.042 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-350 c is 3.100 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-350 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-350 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-350 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-350 d is 14.946 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-350 d is 2.800 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-350 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
