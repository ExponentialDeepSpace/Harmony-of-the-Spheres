{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HD 5278 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 5278 is a star with 1.13 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.19 times its radius. It is located 187.82 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 5278 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 5278 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 5278 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 5278 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 5278 b is 7.804 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 5278 b is 2.450 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 5278 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 5278 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 5278 c was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory, in 2021-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 5278 c is 18.409 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 5278 c is 4.490 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 5278 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 5278","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 5278","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 5278","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 5278","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1522080,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 5278","m":1.13,"radius":11623.255813953489,"temperature":6203,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 5278-c","texture":"HD 5278-c","m":0.000055244427,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":391.67441860465124,"a":0.2416,"e":0.07,"w":8,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":40.87,"temperature":536.4259654716597,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#DB5CAD","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HD 5278-b","texture":"HD 5278-b","m":0.000023418522,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":213.90697674418607,"a":0.1202,"e":0.08,"w":135,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":14.339156,"temperature":943,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A0B0E7","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HD 5278, which contains 2 exoplanets and was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","name":"HD 5278 - System With 2 Exoplanets ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HD 5278 - System With 2 Exolanets "}
