It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HIP 38594 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 38594 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 38594 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 38594 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2020-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 38594 b is 8.106 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 38594 b is 2.770 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 38594 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 38594 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 38594 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2020-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.81 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 38594 c is 48.425 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 38594 c is 7.940 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 38594 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
