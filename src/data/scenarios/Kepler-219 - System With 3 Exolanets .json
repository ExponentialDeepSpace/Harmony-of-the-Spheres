  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-219 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-219 is a star with 1.17 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.49 times its radius. It is located 2567.08 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-219 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-219 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-219 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-219 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-219 b is 8.999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-219 b is 2.950 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-219 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-219 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-219 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-219 c is 12.529 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-219 c is 3.580 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-219 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-219 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-219 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.27 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-219 d is 19.080 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-219 d is 2.810 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-219 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
