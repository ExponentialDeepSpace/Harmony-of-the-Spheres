{"name":"KIC 5437945","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The KIC 5437945 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>KIC 5437945 is a star with 1.07 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.24 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.16 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>KIC 5437945 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the KIC 5437945 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>KIC 5437945 b</h1>\n      <p>KIC 5437945 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 1.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KIC 5437945 b is 33.708 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KIC 5437945 b is 6.4 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, KIC 5437945 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KIC 5437945 c</h1>\n      <p>KIC 5437945 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method.
