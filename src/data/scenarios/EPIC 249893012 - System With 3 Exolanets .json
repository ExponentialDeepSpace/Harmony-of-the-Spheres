It is located 1047.93 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>EPIC 249893012 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the EPIC 249893012 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>EPIC 249893012 b</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 249893012 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 249893012 b is 8.755 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 249893012 b is 1.950 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 249893012 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>EPIC 249893012 c</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 249893012 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 249893012 c is 14.679 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 249893012 c is 3.670 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 249893012 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>EPIC 249893012 d</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 249893012 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.22 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 249893012 d is 10.186 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 249893012 d is 3.940 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 249893012 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
