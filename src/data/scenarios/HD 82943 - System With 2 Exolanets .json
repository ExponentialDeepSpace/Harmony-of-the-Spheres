  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 82943 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 82943 is a star with 1.08 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.18 times its radius. It is located 89.99 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.35 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 82943 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 82943 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 82943 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 82943 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2004-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 82943 b is 534.558 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 82943 b is 13.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 82943 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 82943 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 82943 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2004-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.74 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 82943 c is 622.962 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 82943 c is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 82943 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
