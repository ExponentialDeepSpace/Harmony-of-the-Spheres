{"name":"GJ 1214","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The GJ 1214 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1214 is a star with 0.15 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.22 times its radius. It is located 47.78 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 1214 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 1214 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 1214 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 1214 b was discovered by the MEarth Project observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1214 b is 6.2646 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1214 b is 2.847 that of Earth.  At 6.2646 Earth masses, GJ 1214 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"MEarth Project","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 1214, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by MEarth Project.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 1214","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 1214","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1214_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 1214","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 1214","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":88893,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 1214","m":0.15,"radius":2148.837209302326,"temperature":3026,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 1214-b","texture":"GJ 1214-b","m":0.00001879971,"discoveryFacility":"MEarth Project","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":248.09302325581396,"a":0.01411,"e":0,"w":328.3133015185604,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.58040456,"temperature":488.1512000568463,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1214_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#702A67","clouds":false}]}
