Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 2638 b is 133.56 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 2638 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 2638, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 2638","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 2638","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_2638_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 2638","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 2638","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":252000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 2638","m":0.77,"radius":9181.395348837208,"temperature":5186,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 2638-b","texture":"HD 2638-b","m":0.000400806,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":36.56059077498932,"a":0.04,"e":0,"w":84.96843409971574,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.4442,"temperature":988.7522211334872,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_2638_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#138ED3","clouds":false}]}
