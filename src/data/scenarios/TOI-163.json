It is located 1358.44 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.823 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>TOI-163 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-163 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>TOI-163 b</h1>\n            <p>TOI-163 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-163 b is 387.96 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-163 b is 16.69 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-163 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system TOI-163, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TOI-163","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TOI-163","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-163_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"TOI-163","barycenterMassTwo":"TOI-163","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":365400,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-163","m":1.44,"radius":16116.27906976744,"temperature":6495,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-163-b","texture":"TOI-163-b","m":0.001164246,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1454.372093023256,"a":0.058,"e":0,"w":267.18745607892714,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.231306,"temperature":1669,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-163_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#1D4C66","clouds":false}]}
