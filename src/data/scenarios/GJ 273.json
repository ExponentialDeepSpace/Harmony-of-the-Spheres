It is located 12.39 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 273 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 273 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 273 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 273 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 273 b is 2.89062 times the mass of Earth.   At 2.89062 Earth masses, GJ 273 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 273 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 273 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 273 c is 1.17978 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, GJ 273 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
