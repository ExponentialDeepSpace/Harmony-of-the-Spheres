  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-138 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-138 is a star with 0.92 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.84 times its radius. It is located 660.74 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-138 is known to have 6 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-138 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-138 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-138 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-138 b is 2.827 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-138 b is 1.490 that of Earth.  At 2.827 Earth masses, K2-138 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-138 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-138 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-02, using the transit method.

The radius of K2-138 c is 2.260 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-138 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-138 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-138 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-138 d is 6.614 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-138 d is 2.460 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-138 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-138 e</h1>\n      <p>K2-138 e was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-138 e is 9.858 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-138 e is 3.110 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-138 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-138 f</h1>\n      <p>K2-138 f was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-138 f is 7.918 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-138 f is 2.730 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-138 f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-138 g</h1>\n      <p>K2-138 g was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2021-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-138 g is 10.240 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-138 g is 3.180 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-138 g is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
