It is located 1169.33 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.68 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1150 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1150 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1150 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1150 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1150 b is 1.043 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1150 b is 1.020 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1150 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
