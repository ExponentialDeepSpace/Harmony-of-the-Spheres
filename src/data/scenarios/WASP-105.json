Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-105 b is 572.4 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-105 b is 10.761 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-105 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP-South","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-105, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by SuperWASP-South.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-105","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-105","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-105_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-105","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-105","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":472500,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-105","m":0.89,"radius":8790.697674418605,"temperature":5070,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-105-b","texture":"WASP-105-b","m":0.0017177400000000002,"discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP-South","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":937.6744186046512,"a":0.075,"e":0,"w":203.8676328802725,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":7.87288,"temperature":900,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-105_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#987CE6","clouds":false}]}
