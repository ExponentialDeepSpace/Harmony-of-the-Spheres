The mass of K2-285 b is 9.68 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-285 b is 2.59 that of Earth.  At 9.68 Earth masses, K2-285 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>K2-285 c</h1>\n            <p>K2-285 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method. The mass of K2-285 c is 15.68 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-285 c is 3.53 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-285 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>K2-285 d</h1>\n            <p>K2-285 d was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method.
