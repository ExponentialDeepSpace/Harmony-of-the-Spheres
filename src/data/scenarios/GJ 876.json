The mass of GJ 876 b is 723.2235 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 876 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 876 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 876 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 876 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the Radial Velocity method. The mass of GJ 876 c is 226.9846 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 876 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.

M. Keck Observatory observatory using the Radial Velocity method. The mass of GJ 876 d is 6.83 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.83 Earth masses, GJ 876 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 876 e</h1>\n            <p>GJ 876 e was discovered by the W.
