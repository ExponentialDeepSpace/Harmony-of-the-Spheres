  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The PDS 70 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>PDS 70 is a star with 0.76 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.26 times its radius. It is located 368.77 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.005 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>PDS 70 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the PDS 70 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>PDS 70 b</h1>\n      <p>PDS 70 b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory, in 2018-09, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 20.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PDS 70 b is 954.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PDS 70 b is 30.488 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, PDS 70 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>PDS 70 c</h1>\n      <p>PDS 70 c was discovered by the European Southern Observatory observatory, in 2019-06, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 34.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PDS 70 c is 636.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PDS 70 c is 22.866 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, PDS 70 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
