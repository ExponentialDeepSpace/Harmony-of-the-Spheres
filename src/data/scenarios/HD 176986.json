{"name":"HD 176986","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The HD 176986 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>HD 176986 is a star with 0.79 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.78 times its radius. It is located 90.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 176986 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 176986 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 176986 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 176986 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 176986 b is 5.74308 times the mass of Earth.   At 5.74308 Earth masses, HD 176986 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 176986 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 176986 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 176986 c is 9.18384 times the mass of Earth.   At 9.18384 Earth masses, HD 176986 c is a so called Super Earth.
