It is located 21.30 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 11 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 219134 is known to have 6 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 219134 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 219134 f</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 f was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 f is 7.304460000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 f is 1.31 that of Earth.  At 7.304460000000001 Earth masses, HD 219134 f is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 219134 g</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.38 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 g is 10.812000000000001 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 219134 g is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 219134 h</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 h was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 h is 108.12 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 219134 h is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 219134 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 b is 4.7413799999999995 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 b is 1.602 that of Earth.  At 4.7413799999999995 Earth masses, HD 219134 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 219134 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 c was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 c is 4.36296 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 c is 1.511 that of Earth.  At 4.36296 Earth masses, HD 219134 c is a so called Super Earth.

Its semi-major axis is 0.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 219134 d is 16.179840000000002 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 d is 1.61 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 219134 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
