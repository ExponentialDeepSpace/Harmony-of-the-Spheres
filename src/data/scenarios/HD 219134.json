The mass of HD 219134 f is 7.3 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 219134 f is 1.31 that of Earth.  At 7.3 Earth masses, HD 219134 f is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>HD 219134 g</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the Radial Velocity method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>HD 219134 h</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 h was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the Radial Velocity method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>HD 219134 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 219134 b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the Radial Velocity method.
