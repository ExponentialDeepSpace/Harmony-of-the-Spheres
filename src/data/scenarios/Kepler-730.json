It is located 6589.00 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-730 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-730 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-730 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method.  Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 6.49 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-730.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-730 b is 399.49 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-730 b is 12.33 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-730 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-730 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-730 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method.  Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 2.85 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-730.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-730 c is 2.84 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-730 c is 1.569 that of Earth.  At 2.84 Earth masses, Kepler-730 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
