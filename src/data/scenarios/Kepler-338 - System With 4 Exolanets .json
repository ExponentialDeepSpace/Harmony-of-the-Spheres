  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-338 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-338 is a star with 1.2 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.74 times its radius. It is located 1802.98 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.79 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-338 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-338 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-338 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-338 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-338 b is 30.528 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-338 b is 2.440 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-338 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-338 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-338 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-338 c is 6.074 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-338 c is 2.340 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-338 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-338 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-338 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-338 d is 9.286 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-338 d is 3.000 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-338 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-338 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-338 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-05, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-338 e is 8.586 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-338 e is 1.560 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-338 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
