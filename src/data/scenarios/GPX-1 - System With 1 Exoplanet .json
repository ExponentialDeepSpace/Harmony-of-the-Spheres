{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The GPX-1 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GPX-1 is a star with 1.68 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.56 times its radius. It is located 2136.36 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.27 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GPX-1 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GPX-1 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GPX-1 b</h1>\n      <p>GPX-1 b was discovered by the Acton Sky Portal Observatory observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GPX-1 b is 6264.600 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GPX-1 b is 16.477 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GPX-1 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202306,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GPX-1","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GPX-1","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"GPX-1","barycenterMassTwo":"GPX-1","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":212940,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GPX-1","m":1.68,"radius":15237.209302325582,"temperature":7000,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GPX-1-b","texture":"GPX-1-b","m":0.01879971,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1435.8139534883721,"a":0.0338,"e":1e-7,"w":220.88127288417576,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.744579,"temperature":2300,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#7A9308","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system GPX-1, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Acton Sky Portal Observatory.","name":"GPX-1 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"GPX-1 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
