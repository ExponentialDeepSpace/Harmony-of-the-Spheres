Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 12.70 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-284.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-284 b is 6.68 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-284 b is 2.24 that of Earth.  At 6.68 Earth masses, Kepler-284 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-284 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-284 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.
