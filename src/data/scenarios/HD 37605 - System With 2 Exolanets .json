  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 37605 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 37605 is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.91 times its radius. It is located 152.60 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.65 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 37605 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 37605 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 37605 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 37605 b was discovered by the McDonald Observatory observatory, in 2004-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 37605 b is 855.420 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 37605 b is 13.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 37605 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 37605 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 37605 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2012-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.74 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 37605 c is 1014.420 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 37605 c is 13.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 37605 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
