Its semi-major axis is 2.60 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 18 Del b is 3275.4 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, 18 Del b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Okayama Astrophysical Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system 18 Del, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Okayama Astrophysical Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"18 Del","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"18 Del","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/18_del_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"18 Del","barycenterMassTwo":"18 Del","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":16380000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"18 Del","m":2.3,"radius":83023.2558139535,"temperature":4979,"massType":"star"},{"name":"18 Del-b","texture":"18 Del-b","m":0.009829290000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Okayama Astrophysical Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":140.1651793939154,"a":2.6,"e":0.08,"w":166.1,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":993.3,"temperature":278.64973021779343,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/18_del_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FA219F","clouds":false}]}
