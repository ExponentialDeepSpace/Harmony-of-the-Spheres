  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-244 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-244 is a star with 0.96 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.8 times its radius. It is located 3380.57 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-244 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-244 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-244 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-244 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-244 b is 8.045 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-244 b is 2.760 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-244 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-244 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-244 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-244 c is 4.865 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-244 c is 2.050 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.1, and a semi-major axis of 0.087 astronomical units, Kepler-244 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-244 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-244 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-244 d is 15.264 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-244 d is 2.310 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-244 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
