  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-9 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-9 is a star with 1.02 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.96 times its radius. It is located 2049.10 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-9 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-9 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-9 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-9 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2010-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-9 b is 43.423 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-9 b is 8.290 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-9 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-9 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-9 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2010-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-9 c is 29.917 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-9 c is 8.080 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-9 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-9 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-9 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2011-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-9 d is 3.339 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-9 d is 1.640 that of Earth.  At 3.339 Earth masses, Kepler-9 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
