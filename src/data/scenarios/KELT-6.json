Its semi-major axis is 2.39 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KELT-6 c is 1179.78 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, KELT-6 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KELT-6, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"KELT-6","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"KELT-6","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kelt-6_c/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"KELT-6","barycenterMassTwo":"KELT-6","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":15057000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KELT-6","m":1.42,"radius":16897.674418604653,"temperature":6102,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KELT-6-c","texture":"KELT-6-c","m":0.0035404530000000003,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":91.28208363318186,"a":2.39,"e":0.21,"w":268.7,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1276,"temperature":202.4262042941944,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kelt-6_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#C38003","clouds":false}]}
