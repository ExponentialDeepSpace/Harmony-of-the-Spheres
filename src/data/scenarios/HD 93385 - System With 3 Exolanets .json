{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HD 93385 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 93385 is a star with 1.04 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.18 times its radius. It is located 141.38 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 93385 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 93385 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 93385 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 93385 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 93385 b is 4.201 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 93385 b is 1.880 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.47, and a semi-major axis of 0.0756 astronomical units, HD 93385 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 93385 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 93385 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 93385 c is 7.104 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 93385 c is 2.560 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 93385 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 93385 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 93385 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 93385 d is 8.704 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 93385 d is 2.890 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 93385 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"publishDate":202308,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 93385","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 93385","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 93385","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 93385","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1615950,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 93385","m":1.04,"radius":11525.581395348836,"temperature":5977,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 93385-d","texture":"HD 93385-d","m":0.000026119191,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":252.00000000000003,"a":0.2565,"e":0.09,"w":-55,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":45.85,"temperature":489.19357410139867,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A78B98","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HD 93385-c","texture":"HD 93385-c","m":0.000021319062,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":223.67441860465118,"a":0.112,"e":0.2,"w":236.77175797928538,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":13.18,"temperature":740.3130704161632,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#EBD939","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HD 93385-b","texture":"HD 93385-b","m":0.000012606303,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":164.09302325581396,"a":0.0756,"e":0.295,"w":285.0873472691762,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":7.3426,"temperature":901.0803739618734,"exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"color":"#53C850","clouds":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HD 93385, which contains 3 exoplanets and was discovered by the La Silla Observatory.","name":"HD 93385 - System With 3 Exoplanets ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HD 93385 - System With 3 Exolanets "}
