{"name":"AU Mic","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The AU Mic Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>AU Mic is a star with 0.5 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.75 times its radius. It is located 31.93 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.022 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>AU Mic is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the AU Mic system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>AU Mic b</h1>\n            <p>AU Mic b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of AU Mic b is 57.239999999999995 times the mass of Earth. The radius of AU Mic b is 4.203 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, AU Mic b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system AU Mic, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"AU Mic","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"AU Mic","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"AU Mic","barycenterMassTwo":"AU Mic","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":415800,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"AU Mic","m":0.5,"radius":7325.581395348838,"temperature":3700,"massType":"star"},{"name":"AU Mic-b","texture":"AU Mic-b","m":0.000171774,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":366.2790697674419,"a":0.066,"e":0.1,"w":203.6793864212855,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8.46321,"temperature":556.8073499139025,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#5169F2","clouds":false}]}
