  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 27894 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 27894 is a star with 0.8 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 142.93 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 27894 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 27894 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 27894 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 27894 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2005-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 27894 b is 211.470 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 27894 b is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 27894 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 27894 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 27894 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 27894 c is 51.516 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 27894 c is 8.240 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 27894 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 27894 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 27894 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.45 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 27894 d is 1721.970 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 27894 d is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 27894 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
