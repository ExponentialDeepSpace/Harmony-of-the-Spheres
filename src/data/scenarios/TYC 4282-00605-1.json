It is located 2283.09 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10.1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>TYC 4282-00605-1 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">TYC 4282-00605-1 b</h2>\n            <p>TYC 4282-00605-1 b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method.  Its semi-major axis is 0.42 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 101.54 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, TYC 4282-00605-1.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.28, which means that when TYC 4282-00605-1 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.30 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.54. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of TYC 4282-00605-1 b is 3426.00 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, TYC 4282-00605-1 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
