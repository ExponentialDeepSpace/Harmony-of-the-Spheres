  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 110113 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 110113 is a star with 1 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.97 times its radius. It is located 346.73 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 110113 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 110113 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 110113 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 110113 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 110113 b is 4.554 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 110113 b is 2.050 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.9, and a semi-major axis of 0.035 astronomical units, HD 110113 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 110113 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 110113 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 110113 c is 10.507 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 110113 c is 3.230 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 110113 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
