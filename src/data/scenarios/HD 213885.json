It is located 156.45703319999998 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 213885 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 213885 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>HD 213885 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 213885 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the Transit method. The mass of HD 213885 b is 8.83 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 213885 b is 1.745 that of Earth.  At 8.83 Earth masses, HD 213885 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>HD 213885 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 213885 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the Radial Velocity method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 213885, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 213885","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 213885","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_213885_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 213885","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 213885","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":357827.4,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 213885","m":1.07,"radius":10744.18604651163,"temperature":5978,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 213885-c","texture":"HD 213885-c","m":0.00005990141100000001,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":16.455246668144614,"a":0.056798,"e":0,"w":10.22263262074385,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.78503,"temperature":1265,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_213885_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#80DFCE","clouds":false},{"name":"HD 213885-b","texture":"HD 213885-b","m":0.000026510454,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":152.37209302325581,"a":0.02012,"e":0,"w":352.7811310731793,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.008035,"temperature":2128,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_213885_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":0.5,"color":"#51DF6F","clouds":false}]}
