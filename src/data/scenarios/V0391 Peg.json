It is located 4566.18 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>V0391 Peg is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">V0391 Peg b</h2>\n            <p>V0391 Peg b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the pulsation timing variations method. Its discovery was announced in 2007-09. Its semi-major axis is 1.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 1170.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, V0391 Peg.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0, which means that when V0391 Peg b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 1.70 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 1.70. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of V0391 Peg b is 1016.99 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, V0391 Peg b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
