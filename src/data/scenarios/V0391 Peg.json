It is located 4566.18 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>V0391 Peg is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the V0391 Peg system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>V0391 Peg b</h1>\n            <p>V0391 Peg b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the pulsation timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 1.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of V0391 Peg b is 1017.6 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, V0391 Peg b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system V0391 Peg, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Multiple Observatories.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"V0391 Peg","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"V0391 Peg","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/v391_peg_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"V0391 Peg","barycenterMassTwo":"V0391 Peg","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":10710000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"V0391 Peg","m":0.5,"radius":2246.511627906977,"temperature":29300,"massType":"star"},{"name":"V0391 Peg-b","texture":"V0391 Peg-b","m":0.0030537600000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":85.78502728200992,"a":1.7,"e":0,"w":48.17127178568283,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1170,"temperature":109.71157921782493,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/v391_peg_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FAC5D2","clouds":false}]}
