Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-53 b is 677.976 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-53 b is 12.038 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-53 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>WASP-53 c</h1>\n            <p>WASP-53 c was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory using the radial velocity method.
