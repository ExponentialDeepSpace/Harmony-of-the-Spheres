{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A is a star with 0.01 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.24 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.003 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A b</h1>\n      <p>CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A b was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope observatory, in 2020-12, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 200.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A b is 2480.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A b is 20.849 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Imaging","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A","barycenterMassTwo":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1260000000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A","m":0.01,"radius":2344.186046511628,"temperature":2320,"massType":"star"},{"name":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A-b","texture":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A-b","m":0.00744354,"discoveryFacility":"Imaging","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1816.744186046512,"a":200,"e":0,"w":315.0613948227224,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":8040000,"temperature":1800,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#8F3D37","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope.","name":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"CFHTWIR-Oph 98 A - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
