It is located 689.05 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-226 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-226 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-226 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-226 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-226 b is 2.989 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-226 b is 1.540 that of Earth.  At 2.989 Earth masses, K2-226 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
