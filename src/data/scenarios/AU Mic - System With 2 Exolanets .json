  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The AU Mic Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>AU Mic is a star with 0.5 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.75 times its radius. It is located 31.71 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.022 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>AU Mic is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the AU Mic system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>AU Mic b</h1>\n      <p>AU Mic b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-06, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of AU Mic b is 17.010 times the mass of Earth. The radius of AU Mic b is 4.070 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, AU Mic b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>AU Mic c</h1>\n      <p>AU Mic c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of AU Mic c is 13.607 times the mass of Earth. The radius of AU Mic c is 3.240 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, AU Mic c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
