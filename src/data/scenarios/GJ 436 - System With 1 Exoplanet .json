It is located 31.81 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 436 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 436 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 436 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 436 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2004-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 436 b is 22.260 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 436 b is 4.170 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 436 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
