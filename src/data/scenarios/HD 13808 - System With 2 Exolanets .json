  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 13808 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 13808 is a star with 0.77 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.78 times its radius. It is located 92.08 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 13808 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 13808 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 13808 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 13808 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 13808 b is 11.206 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 13808 b is 3.350 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 13808 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 13808 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 13808 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 13808 c is 9.966 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 13808 c is 3.130 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 13808 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
