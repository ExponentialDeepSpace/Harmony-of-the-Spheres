It is located 84.41 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HIP 57274 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 57274 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HIP 57274 b</h1>\n            <p>HIP 57274 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 57274 b is 6.36 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.36 Earth masses, HIP 57274 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HIP 57274 c</h1>\n            <p>HIP 57274 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 57274 c is 130.06835999999998 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 57274 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HIP 57274 d</h1>\n            <p>HIP 57274 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 57274 d is 167.49059999999997 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 57274 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
