  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The ups And Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>ups And is a star with 1.3 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.56 times its radius. It is located 43.72 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>ups And is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the ups And system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>ups And b</h1>\n      <p>ups And b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory, in 1997-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of ups And b is 218.657 times the mass of Earth. The radius of ups And b is 14.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, ups And b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>ups And c</h1>\n      <p>ups And c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 1999-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.83 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of ups And c is 629.958 times the mass of Earth. The radius of ups And c is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, ups And c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>ups And d</h1>\n      <p>ups And d was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 1999-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.51 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of ups And d is 1313.976 times the mass of Earth. The radius of ups And d is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, ups And d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
