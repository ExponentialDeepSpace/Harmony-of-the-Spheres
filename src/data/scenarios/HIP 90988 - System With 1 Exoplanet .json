{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HIP 90988 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 90988 is a star with 1.3 times the mass of the Sun, and 3.94 times its radius. It is located 306.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.55 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 90988 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 90988 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 90988 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 90988 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 90988 b is 623.280 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 90988 b is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 90988 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HIP 90988","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HIP 90988","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HIP 90988","barycenterMassTwo":"HIP 90988","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":7938000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 90988","m":1.3,"radius":38483.72093023256,"temperature":4883,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 90988-b","texture":"HIP 90988-b","m":0.0018704280000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1172.093023255814,"a":1.26,"e":0.08,"w":161.6,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":453.9,"temperature":260.9285888691673,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#487C5C","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HIP 90988, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Multiple Observatories.","name":"HIP 90988 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HIP 90988 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
