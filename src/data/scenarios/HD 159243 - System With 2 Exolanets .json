It is located 239.09 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.25 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 159243 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 159243 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 159243 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 159243 b was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2014-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 159243 b is 359.340 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 159243 b is 13.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 159243 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 159243 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 159243 c was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2014-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.80 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 159243 c is 604.200 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 159243 c is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 159243 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
