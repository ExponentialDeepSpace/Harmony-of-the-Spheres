  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 66428 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 66428 is a star with 1.08 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.1 times its radius. It is located 173.78 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.515 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 66428 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 66428 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 66428 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 66428 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2006-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.47 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 66428 b is 1018.872 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 66428 b is 13.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 66428 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 66428 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 66428 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 23.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 66428 c is 8586.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 66428 c is 11.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 66428 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
