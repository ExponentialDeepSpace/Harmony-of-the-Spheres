  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The L 98-59 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>L 98-59 is a star with 0.31 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.31 times its radius. It is located 34.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>L 98-59 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the L 98-59 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>L 98-59 b</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 b is 1.011 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 b is 0.800 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, L 98-59 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 c</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 c is 2.420 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 c is 1.350 that of Earth.  At 2.420 Earth masses, L 98-59 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 d</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 d is 2.312 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 d is 1.570 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.3, and a semi-major axis of 0.0506 astronomical units, L 98-59 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
