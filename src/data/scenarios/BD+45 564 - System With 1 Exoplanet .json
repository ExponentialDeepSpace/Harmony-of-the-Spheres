{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The BD+45 564 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>BD+45 564 is a star with 0.81 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.81 times its radius. It is located 174.89 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>BD+45 564 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the BD+45 564 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>BD+45 564 b</h1>\n      <p>BD+45 564 b was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2021-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.83 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of BD+45 564 b is 432.480 times the mass of Earth. The radius of BD+45 564 b is 13.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, BD+45 564 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"BD+45 564","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"BD+45 564","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"BD+45 564","barycenterMassTwo":"BD+45 564","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":5229000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"BD+45 564","m":0.81,"radius":7911.627906976745,"temperature":5004,"massType":"star"},{"name":"BD+45 564-b","texture":"BD+45 564-b","m":0.001297848,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1181.860465116279,"a":0.83,"e":0.12,"w":70.31,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":307.88,"temperature":225.4624084090987,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#E64DB8","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system BD+45 564, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory.","name":"BD+45 564 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"BD+45 564 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
