It is located 55.42 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 7924 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 7924 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 7924 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 7924 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2009-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 7924 b is 6.360 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 7924 b is 2.400 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 7924 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 7924 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 7924 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2015-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 7924 c is 7.864 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 7924 c is 2.720 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 7924 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 7924 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 7924 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2015-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 7924 d is 6.443 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 7924 d is 2.420 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 7924 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
