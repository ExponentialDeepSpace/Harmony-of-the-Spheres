  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-415 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-415 is a star with 0.67 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.64 times its radius. It is located 1730.22 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-415 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-415 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-415 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-415 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-05, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-415 b is 119.886 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-415 b is 1.210 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-415 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-415 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-415 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-05, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-415 c is 4.706 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-415 c is 2.010 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.18, and a semi-major axis of 0.0695 astronomical units, Kepler-415 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
