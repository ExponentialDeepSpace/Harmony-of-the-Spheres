It is located 87.66 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 181433 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 181433 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 181433 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 181433 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2009-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 181433 b is 6.360 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 181433 b is 2.400 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 181433 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 181433 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 181433 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2009-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.76 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 181433 c is 203.520 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 181433 c is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 181433 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 181433 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 181433 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2009-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 181433 d is 171.720 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 181433 d is 14.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 181433 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
