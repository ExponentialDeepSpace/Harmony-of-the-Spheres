  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 85512 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 85512 is a star with 0.43 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.71 times its radius. It is located 36.79 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.61 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 85512 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 85512 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 85512 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 85512 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2011-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 85512 b is 3.498 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 85512 b is 1.720 that of Earth.  At 3.498 Earth masses, HD 85512 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     HD 85512 b orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
