{"name":"TOI-132","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The TOI-132 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>TOI-132 is a star with 0.97 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.9 times its radius. It is located 536.43 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.34 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>TOI-132 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-132 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>TOI-132 b</h1>\n            <p>TOI-132 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-132 b is 22.41264 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-132 b is 3.42 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-132 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system TOI-132, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TOI-132","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TOI-132","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-132_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"TOI-132","barycenterMassTwo":"TOI-132","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":163800,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-132","m":0.97,"radius":8790.697674418605,"temperature":5397,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-132-b","texture":"TOI-132-b","m":0.000067259064,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":297.90697674418607,"a":0.026,"e":0.059,"w":125.88,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2.1097019,"temperature":1395,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-132_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2978A5","clouds":false}]}
