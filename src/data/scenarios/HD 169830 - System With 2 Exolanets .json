It is located 122.65 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 169830 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 169830 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 169830 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 169830 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2001-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.81 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 169830 b is 915.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 169830 b is 13.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 169830 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 169830 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 169830 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2004-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.60 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 169830 c is 1284.720 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 169830 c is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 169830 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
