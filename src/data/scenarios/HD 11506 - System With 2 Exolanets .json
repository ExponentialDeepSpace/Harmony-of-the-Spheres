It is located 167.19 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 11506 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 11506 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 11506 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 11506 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2007-11, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.90 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 11506 b is 1535.940 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 11506 b is 12.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 11506 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 11506 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 11506 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2009-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.77 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 11506 c is 129.744 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 11506 c is 14.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 11506 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
