It is located 363.34 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>TOI-125 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-125 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>TOI-125 b</h1>\n            <p>TOI-125 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-125 b is 9.50502 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-125 b is 2.726 that of Earth.  At 9.50502 Earth masses, TOI-125 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>TOI-125 c</h1>\n            <p>TOI-125 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-125 c is 6.63348 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-125 c is 2.759 that of Earth.  At 6.63348 Earth masses, TOI-125 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>TOI-125 d</h1>\n            <p>TOI-125 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-125 d is 13.60722 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-125 d is 2.93 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-125 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
