  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-128 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-128 is a star with 1.09 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.61 times its radius. It is located 1292.81 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.07 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-128 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-128 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-128 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-128 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-128 b is 0.770 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-128 b is 1.430 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 1.46, and a semi-major axis of 0.1231 astronomical units, Kepler-128 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-128 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-128 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-128 c is 0.900 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-128 c is 1.340 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.07, and a semi-major axis of 0.1622 astronomical units, Kepler-128 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
