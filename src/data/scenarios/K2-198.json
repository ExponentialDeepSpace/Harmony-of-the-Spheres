{"name":"K2-198","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-198 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-198 is a star with 0.8 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.76 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-198 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-198 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-198 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-198 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-198 b is 16.345200000000002 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-198 b is 4.189 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-198 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-198 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-198 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-198 c is 2.61396 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-198 c is 1.423 that of Earth.  At 2.61396 Earth masses, K2-198 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-198 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-198 d was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-198 d is 6.519 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-198 d is 2.438 that of Earth.  At 6.519 Earth masses, K2-198 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-198, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-198","m":0.8,"radius":7423.2558139534885,"temperature":5212.9,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-198-d","texture":"K2-198-d","m":0.000019563150000000003,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":212.93023255813955,"a":null,"e":0,"w":359.60459307216206,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":7.4500177,"temperature":943,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#10A6C4","clouds":false},{"name":"K2-198-c","texture":"K2-198-c","m":0.000007844346,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":124.04651162790698,"a":null,"e":0,"w":204.3820800029538,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.3596055,"temperature":1230,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B9AEE4","clouds":false},{"name":"K2-198-b","texture":"K2-198-b","m":0.00004905102,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":365.3023255813954,"a":null,"e":0,"w":212.75556435988045,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":17.0428683,"temperature":716,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#DD32FC","clouds":false}]}
