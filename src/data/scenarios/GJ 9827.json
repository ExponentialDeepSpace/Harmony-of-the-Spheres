It is located 96.8357164 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>GJ 9827 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 9827 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 9827 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 9827 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method. The mass of GJ 9827 b is 4.91 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9827 b is 1.577 that of Earth.  At 4.91 Earth masses, GJ 9827 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 9827 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 9827 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method. The mass of GJ 9827 c is 0.84 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9827 c is 1.241 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, GJ 9827 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 9827 d</h1>\n            <p>GJ 9827 d was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method. The mass of GJ 9827 d is 4.04 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9827 d is 2.022 that of Earth.  At 4.04 Earth masses, GJ 9827 d is a so called Super Earth.
