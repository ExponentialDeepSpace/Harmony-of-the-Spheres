It is located 78.51 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>HIP 70849 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">HIP 70849 b</h2>\n            <p>HIP 70849 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its discovery was announced in 2011-11. Its semi-major axis is 20.25 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 17337.50 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, HIP 70849.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.715, which means that when HIP 70849 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 5.77 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 34.73. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of HIP 70849 b is 2860.29 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 70849 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
