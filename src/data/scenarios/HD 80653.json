It is located 358.31 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.67 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 80653 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 80653 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 80653 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 80653 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 80653 b is 5.60316 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 80653 b is 1.613 that of Earth.  At 5.60316 Earth masses, HD 80653 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
