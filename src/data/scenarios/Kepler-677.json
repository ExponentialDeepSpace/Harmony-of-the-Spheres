{"name":"Kepler-677","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The Kepler-677 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-677 is a star with 1 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.99 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.57 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-677 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-677 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-677 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-677 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-677 b is 24.9948 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-677 b is 5.38 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-677 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-677, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":422100,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-677","m":1,"radius":9669.767441860466,"temperature":5723,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-677-b","texture":"Kepler-677-b","m":0.00007500798000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":468.8372093023256,"a":0.067,"e":0,"w":157.61349974714304,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":6.57531678,"temperature":1015,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#627620","clouds":false}]}
