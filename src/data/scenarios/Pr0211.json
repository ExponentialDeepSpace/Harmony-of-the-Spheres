Its semi-major axis is 5.50 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Pr0211 c is 2477.22 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, Pr0211 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Pr0211 b</h1>\n            <p>Pr0211 b was discovered by the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method.
