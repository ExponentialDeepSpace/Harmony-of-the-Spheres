{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HD 189567 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 189567 is a star with 0.83 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.04 times its radius. It is located 58.40 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 11 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 189567 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 189567 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 189567 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 189567 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 189567 b is 8.503 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 189567 b is 2.850 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 189567 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 189567 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 189567 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2021-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 189567 c is 7.002 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 189567 c is 2.540 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 189567 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"publishDate":202308,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 189567","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 189567","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 189567","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 189567","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1241100,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 189567","m":0.83,"radius":10158.139534883721,"temperature":5726,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 189567-c","texture":"HD 189567-c","m":0.000021013686000000004,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":221.72093023255815,"a":0.197,"e":0.16,"w":219,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":33.688,"temperature":471.3297794187587,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#F9A2BB","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HD 189567-b","texture":"HD 189567-b","m":0.000025517982000000003,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":248.09302325581396,"a":0.111,"e":0.189,"w":130.29056819333678,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":14.288,"temperature":627.9087047779423,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#7D76C1","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HD 189567, which contains 2 exoplanets and was discovered by the La Silla Observatory.","name":"HD 189567 - System With 2 Exoplanets ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HD 189567 - System With 2 Exolanets "}
