Its semi-major axis is 0.37 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-419 b is 795 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-419 b is 10.8 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-419 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-419 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-419 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 1.68 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-419 c is 2321.4 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-419 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-419, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-419","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-419","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-419_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-419","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-419","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":10584000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-419","m":1.39,"radius":16995.3488372093,"temperature":6430,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-419-c","texture":"Kepler-419-c","m":0.00696639,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":121.29533661647157,"a":1.68,"e":0.184,"w":275.3,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":675.47,"temperature":237.60516840565552,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-419_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A9825B","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-419-b","texture":"Kepler-419-b","m":0.0023857500000000003,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":937.6744186046512,"a":0.37,"e":0.833,"w":95.2,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":69.7546,"temperature":506.30202226983556,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-419_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#449E12","clouds":false}]}
