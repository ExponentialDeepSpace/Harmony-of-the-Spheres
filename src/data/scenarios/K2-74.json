Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 19.57 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-74.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-74 b is 7.17 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-74 b is 2.31 that of Earth.  At 7.17 Earth masses, K2-74 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
