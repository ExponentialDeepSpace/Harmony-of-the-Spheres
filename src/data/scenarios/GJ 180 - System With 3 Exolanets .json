It is located 38.95 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 180 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 180 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 180 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 180 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 180 b is 6.494 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 180 b is 2.430 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 180 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 180 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 180 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 180 c is 6.405 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 180 c is 2.410 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 180 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 180 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 180 d was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory, in 2020-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.31 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 180 d is 7.565 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 180 d is 2.660 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 180 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
