Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.

Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.
