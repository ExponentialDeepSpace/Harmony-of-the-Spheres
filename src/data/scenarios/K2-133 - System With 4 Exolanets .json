  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-133 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-133 is a star with 0.46 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.46 times its radius. It is located 245.17 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-133 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-133 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-133 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-133 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-133 b is 2.360 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-133 b is 1.340 that of Earth.  At 2.360 Earth masses, K2-133 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-133 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-133 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-133 c is 3.212 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-133 c is 1.603 that of Earth.  At 3.212 Earth masses, K2-133 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-133 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-133 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-133 d is 4.675 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-133 d is 2.003 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.19, and a semi-major axis of 0.07487 astronomical units, K2-133 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-133 e</h1>\n      <p>K2-133 e was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-133 e is 3.657 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-133 e is 1.730 that of Earth.  At 3.657 Earth masses, K2-133 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
