It is located 3812.73 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>KOI-1599 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the KOI-1599 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>KOI-1599 b</h1>\n            <p>KOI-1599 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-1599 b is 9.00576 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-1599 b is 1.9 that of Earth.  At 9.00576 Earth masses, KOI-1599 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>KOI-1599 c</h1>\n            <p>KOI-1599 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-1599 c is 4.60146 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-1599 c is 1.9 that of Earth.  At 4.60146 Earth masses, KOI-1599 c is a so called Super Earth.
