  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-653 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-653 is a star with 1.02 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.19 times its radius. It is located 1942.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.76 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-653 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-653 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-653 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-653 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-653 b is 4.452 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-653 b is 1.950 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.31, and a semi-major axis of 0.1197 astronomical units, Kepler-653 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-653 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-653 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-653 c is 0.401 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-653 c is 0.780 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-653 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
