{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The TIC 172900988 Aa Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TIC 172900988 Aa is a star with 1.24 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.38 times its radius. It is located 818.51 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TIC 172900988 Aa is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TIC 172900988 Aa system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TIC 172900988 Aa b</h1>\n      <p>TIC 172900988 Aa b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.90 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TIC 172900988 Aa b is 942.507 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TIC 172900988 Aa b is 11.250 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TIC 172900988 Aa b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202306,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TIC 172900988 Aa","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TIC 172900988 Aa","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"TIC 172900988 Aa","barycenterMassTwo":"TIC 172900988 Aa","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":5687703,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TIC 172900988 Aa","m":1.24,"radius":13479.069767441859,"temperature":6050,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TIC 172900988 Aa-b","texture":"TIC 172900988 Aa-b","m":0.002828411598,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":980.6511627906978,"a":0.90281,"e":0.0271,"w":159.4,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":200.452,"temperature":297.52091932998815,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FD5AEA","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system TIC 172900988 Aa, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","name":"TIC 172900988 Aa - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"TIC 172900988 Aa - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
