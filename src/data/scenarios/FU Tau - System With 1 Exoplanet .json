It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.001 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>FU Tau is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the FU Tau system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>FU Tau b</h1>\n      <p>FU Tau b was discovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope observatory, in 2009-02, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 800.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of FU Tau b is 5088.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of FU Tau b is 12.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, FU Tau b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
