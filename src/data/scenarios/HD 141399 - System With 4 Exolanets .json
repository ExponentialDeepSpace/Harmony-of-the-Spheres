The radius of HD 141399 c is 13.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 141399 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 141399 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 141399 d was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 141399 d is 375.240 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 141399 d is 13.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 141399 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 141399 e</h1>\n      <p>HD 141399 e was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 141399 e is 209.880 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 141399 e is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 141399 e is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
