  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-392 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-392 is a star with 1.07 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.13 times its radius. It is located 2222.52 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.97 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-392 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-392 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-392 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-392 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-392 b is 0.973 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-392 b is 1.000 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-392 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-392 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-392 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-392 c is 1.367 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-392 c is 1.100 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-392 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
