  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The PSR B0329+54 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>PSR B0329+54 is a star with 1.44 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>PSR B0329+54 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the PSR B0329+54 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>PSR B0329+54 b</h1>\n      <p>PSR B0329+54 b was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory, in 2017-11, using the pulsar timing method. Its semi-major axis is 10.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PSR B0329+54 b is 1.972 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PSR B0329+54 b is 1.220 that of Earth.  At 1.972 Earth masses, PSR B0329+54 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 10.26 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of PSR B0329+54, PSR B0329+54 b is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
