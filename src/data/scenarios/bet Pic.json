It is located 64.42 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>bet Pic is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">bet Pic b</h2>\n            <p>bet Pic b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory using the imaging method. Its discovery was announced in 2009-01. Its semi-major axis is 9.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 7665.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, bet Pic.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.08, which means that when bet Pic b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 8.37 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 9.83. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of bet Pic b is 0.00 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, bet Pic b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">bet Pic c</h2>\n            <p>bet Pic c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its discovery was announced in 2019-08. Its semi-major axis is 2.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 1200.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, bet Pic.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.24, which means that when bet Pic c is at is at its closest point to its host star, 2.05 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 3.35. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of bet Pic c is 2860.29 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, bet Pic c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
