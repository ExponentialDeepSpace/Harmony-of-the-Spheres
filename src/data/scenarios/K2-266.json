It is located 251.66 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>K2-266 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-266 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>K2-266 b</h1>\n            <p>K2-266 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-266 b is 11.273100000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-266 b is 3.3 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-266 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>K2-266 c</h1>\n            <p>K2-266 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-266 c is 0.28938 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-266 c is 0.705 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, K2-266 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>K2-266 d</h1>\n            <p>K2-266 d was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-266 d is 8.904 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-266 d is 2.93 that of Earth.  At 8.904 Earth masses, K2-266 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>K2-266 e</h1>\n            <p>K2-266 e was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-266 e is 14.30682 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-266 e is 2.73 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-266 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
