Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of CoRoT-7 c is 8.40474 times the mass of Earth.   At 8.40474 Earth masses, CoRoT-7 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
