It is located 505.41 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-285 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-285 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-285 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-285 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-285 b is 9.686 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-285 b is 2.590 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-285 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-285 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-285 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-285 c is 15.687 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-285 c is 3.530 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-285 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-285 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-285 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-285 d is 6.503 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-285 d is 2.480 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-285 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-285 e</h1>\n      <p>K2-285 e was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-285 e is 10.707 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-285 e is 1.950 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-285 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
