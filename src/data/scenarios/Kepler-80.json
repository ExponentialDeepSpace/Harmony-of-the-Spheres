Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-80 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-80 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method.
