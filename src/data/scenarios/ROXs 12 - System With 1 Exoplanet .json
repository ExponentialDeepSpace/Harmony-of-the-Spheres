  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The ROXs 12 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>ROXs 12 is a star with 0.87 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.07 times its radius. It is located 445.69 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.008 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>ROXs 12 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the ROXs 12 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>ROXs 12 b</h1>\n      <p>ROXs 12 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2014-01, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 210.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of ROXs 12 b is 5088.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of ROXs 12 b is 12.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, ROXs 12 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
