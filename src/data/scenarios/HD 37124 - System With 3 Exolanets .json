It is located 103.27 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 37124 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 37124 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 37124 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 37124 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2003-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.53 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 37124 b is 214.650 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 37124 b is 14.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 37124 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 37124 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 37124 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2003-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.71 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 37124 c is 207.336 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 37124 c is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 37124 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 37124 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 37124 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2005-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.81 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 37124 d is 221.328 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 37124 d is 14.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 37124 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
