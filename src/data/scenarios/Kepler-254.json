It is located 4717.68 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-254 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-254 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-254 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 5.83 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-254.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-254 b is 24.71 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-254 b is 3.87 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-254 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-254 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-254 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 12.41 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-254.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-254 c is 6.05 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-254 c is 2.15 that of Earth.  At 6.05 Earth masses, Kepler-254 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-254 d</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-254 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.
