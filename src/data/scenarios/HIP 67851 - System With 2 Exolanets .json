It is located 209.13 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HIP 67851 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 67851 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 67851 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 67851 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2015-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.46 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 67851 b is 438.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 67851 b is 13.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 67851 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 67851 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 67851 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2015-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.82 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 67851 c is 2003.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 67851 c is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 67851 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
