  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 20794 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 20794 is a star with 0.7 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 19.58 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.76 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 20794 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 20794 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 20794 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 20794 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2011-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20794 b is 2.703 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20794 b is 1.450 that of Earth.  At 2.703 Earth masses, HD 20794 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 20794 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 20794 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2011-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20794 c is 2.417 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20794 c is 1.350 that of Earth.  At 2.417 Earth masses, HD 20794 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 20794 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 20794 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2011-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.35 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20794 d is 4.770 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20794 d is 2.040 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.11, and a semi-major axis of 0.3499 astronomical units, HD 20794 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 20794 e</h1>\n      <p>HD 20794 e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-09, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.51 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20794 e is 4.773 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20794 e is 2.030 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.13, and a semi-major axis of 0.509 astronomical units, HD 20794 e could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
