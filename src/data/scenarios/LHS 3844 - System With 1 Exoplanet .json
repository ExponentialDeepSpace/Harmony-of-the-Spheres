  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The LHS 3844 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>LHS 3844 is a star with 0.15 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.19 times its radius. It is located 48.55 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>LHS 3844 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LHS 3844 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LHS 3844 b</h1>\n      <p>LHS 3844 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LHS 3844 b is 2.251 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LHS 3844 b is 1.303 that of Earth.  At 2.251 Earth masses, LHS 3844 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
