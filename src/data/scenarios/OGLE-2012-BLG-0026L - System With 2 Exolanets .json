  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L is a star with 1.06 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 13108.21 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L b</h1>\n      <p>OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L b was discovered by the OGLE observatory, in 2013-01, using the microlensing method. Its semi-major axis is 4.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L b is 46.110 times the mass of Earth. The radius of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L b is 7.720 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L c</h1>\n      <p>OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L c was discovered by the OGLE observatory, in 2013-01, using the microlensing method. Its semi-major axis is 4.80 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L c is 273.480 times the mass of Earth. The radius of OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L c is 13.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
