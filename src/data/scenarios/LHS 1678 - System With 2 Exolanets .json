  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The LHS 1678 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>LHS 1678 is a star with 0.34 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.33 times its radius. It is located 64.83 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>LHS 1678 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LHS 1678 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LHS 1678 b</h1>\n      <p>LHS 1678 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LHS 1678 b is 0.350 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LHS 1678 b is 0.696 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, LHS 1678 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>LHS 1678 c</h1>\n      <p>LHS 1678 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LHS 1678 c is 1.399 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LHS 1678 c is 0.982 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, LHS 1678 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
