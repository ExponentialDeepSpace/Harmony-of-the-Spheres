  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-276 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-276 is a star with 1.04 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.05 times its radius. It is located 3734.03 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-276 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-276 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-276 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-276 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-276 b is 8.618 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-276 b is 2.870 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-276 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-276 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-276 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-276 c is 16.536 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-276 c is 2.900 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-276 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-276 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-276 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-276 d is 16.218 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-276 d is 2.800 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-276 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
