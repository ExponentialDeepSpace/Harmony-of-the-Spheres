{"name":"HIP 41378","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HIP 41378 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 41378 is a star with 1.17 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.34 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HIP 41378 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 41378 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 41378 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 41378 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 41378 b is 8.745 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 41378 b is 2.9 that of Earth.  At 8.745 Earth masses, HIP 41378 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 41378 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 41378 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 41378 c is 7.0914 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 41378 c is 2.56 that of Earth.  At 7.0914 Earth masses, HIP 41378 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 41378 d</h1>\n      <p>HIP 41378 d was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 41378 d is 14.8506 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 41378 d is 3.96 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 41378 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 41378 e</h1>\n      <p>HIP 41378 e was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 41378 e is 26.0442 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 41378 e is 5.51 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 41378 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 41378 f</h1>\n      <p>HIP 41378 f was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 41378 f is 74.09400000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 41378 f is 10.2 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 41378 f is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HIP 41378, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 41378","m":1.17,"radius":13088.372093023258,"temperature":6226,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 41378-f","texture":"HIP 41378-f","m":0.00022235190000000004,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":888.8372093023256,"a":null,"e":0,"w":40.20668386860272,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1084,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#E2427E","clouds":false},{"name":"HIP 41378-e","texture":"HIP 41378-e","m":0.00007815717,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":480.55813953488376,"a":null,"e":0,"w":329.548911086148,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":131,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#1AAD83","clouds":false},{"name":"HIP 41378-d","texture":"HIP 41378-d","m":0.00004456581,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":344.7906976744186,"a":null,"e":0,"w":52.9107313120455,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1114,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#58253E","clouds":false},{"name":"HIP 41378-c","texture":"HIP 41378-c","m":0.00002128089,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":222.69767441860466,"a":null,"e":0,"w":359.2086267473306,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":31.70648,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#94FBD9","clouds":false},{"name":"HIP 41378-b","texture":"HIP 41378-b","m":0.00002624325,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":252.97674418604655,"a":null,"e":0,"w":214.94139517990158,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":15.572098,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#F22CFA","clouds":false}]}
