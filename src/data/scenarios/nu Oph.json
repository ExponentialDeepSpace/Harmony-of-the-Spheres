{"name":"nu Oph","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The nu Oph Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>nu Oph is a star with 2.7 times the mass of the Sun, and 14.6 times its radius. It is located 150.68 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.65 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>nu Oph is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the nu Oph system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>nu Oph b</h1>\n            <p>nu Oph b was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.79 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of nu Oph b is 7061.508 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, nu Oph b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>nu Oph c</h1>\n            <p>nu Oph c was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method.
