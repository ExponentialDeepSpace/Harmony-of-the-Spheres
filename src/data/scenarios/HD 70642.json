It is located 95.56 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.919 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 70642 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 70642 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 70642 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 70642 b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.32 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 70642 b is 633.774 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 70642 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Anglo-Australian Telescope","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 70642, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Anglo-Australian Telescope.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 70642","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 70642","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_70642_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 70642","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 70642","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":20903400,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 70642","m":1.08,"radius":9572.093023255813,"temperature":5732,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 70642-b","texture":"HD 70642-b","m":0.0019019199000000003,"discoveryFacility":"Anglo-Australian Telescope","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":70.31396173211172,"a":3.318,"e":0.175,"w":272.84,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2124.54,"temperature":139.91975939506474,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_70642_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A5852E","clouds":false}]}
