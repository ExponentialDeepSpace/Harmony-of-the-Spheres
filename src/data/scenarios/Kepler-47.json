{"name":"Kepler-47","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The Kepler-47 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-47 is a star with 0.96 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.94 times its radius. It is located 3442.02 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-47 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-47 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-47 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-47 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.29 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-47 b is 2.07018 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-47 b is 3.05 that of Earth.  At 2.07018 Earth masses, Kepler-47 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-47 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-47 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.96 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-47 c is 3.17046 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-47 c is 4.65 that of Earth.  At 3.17046 Earth masses, Kepler-47 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   With a mass of 3.17046 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.9638 astronomical units, Kepler-47 c could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-47 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-47 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.70 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-47 d is 19.02912 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-47 d is 7.04 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-47 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-47, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-47","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-47","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-47_%28ab%29_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-47","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-47","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":6071940,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-47","m":0.96,"radius":9181.395348837208,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-47-d","texture":"Kepler-47-d","m":0.000057105312,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":613.3953488372093,"a":0.6992,"e":0.024,"w":352,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":187.366,"temperature":279.0307965367282,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-47_(ab)_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#483AF4","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-47-c","texture":"Kepler-47-c","m":0.000009514371,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":true,"radius":405.3488372093023,"a":0.9638,"e":0.044,"w":306,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":303.227,"temperature":237.6618030827514,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-47_%28ab%29_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"color":"#2D6B39","clouds":true},{"name":"Kepler-47-b","texture":"Kepler-47-b","m":0.000006212493,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":265.6744186046512,"a":0.2877,"e":0.021,"w":48.6,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":49.4643,"temperature":434.9936505188318,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-47_%28ab%29_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#8FA912","clouds":false}]}
