  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The WASP-18 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>WASP-18 is a star with 1.22 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.23 times its radius. It is located 402.75 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>WASP-18 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-18 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>WASP-18 b</h1>\n      <p>WASP-18 b was discovered by the SuperWASP observatory, in 2009-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-18 b is 3316.594 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-18 b is 13.350 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-18 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>WASP-18 c</h1>\n      <p>WASP-18 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-12, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-18 c is 55.230 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-18 c is 8.580 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-18 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
