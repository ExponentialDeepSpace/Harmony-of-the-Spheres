  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-2202 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-2202 is a star with 0.82 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.79 times its radius. It is located 769.51 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.48 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-2202 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-2202 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-2202 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-2202 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-2202 b is 311.004 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-2202 b is 11.321 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-2202 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-2202 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-2202 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-2202 c is 117.342 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-2202 c is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-2202 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
