{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L is a star with 0.37 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 24135.54 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L b</h1>\n      <p>OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L b was discovered by the OGLE observatory, in 2021-08, using the microlensing method. Its semi-major axis is 1.54 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L b is 8.405 times the mass of Earth. The radius of OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L b is 2.830 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Microlensing","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202307,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L","barycenterMassTwo":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":9702000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L","m":0.37,"radius":3125.5813953488373,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L-b","texture":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L-b","m":0.000025222149,"discoveryFacility":"Microlensing","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":247.11627906976747,"a":1.54,"e":null,"w":196.82896191785122,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":null,"temperature":91.96876540450756,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#036550","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the OGLE.","name":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"OGLE-2018-BLG-1185L - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
