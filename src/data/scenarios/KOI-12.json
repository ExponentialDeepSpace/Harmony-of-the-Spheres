Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-12 b is 349.8 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-12 b is 13.787 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KOI-12 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>KOI-12 c</h1>\n            <p>KOI-12 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 4.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-12 c is 6996 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, KOI-12 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KOI-12, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"KOI-12","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"KOI-12","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-448_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"KOI-12","barycenterMassTwo":"KOI-12","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":26460000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KOI-12","m":1.5,"radius":13674.418604651162,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KOI-12-c","texture":"KOI-12-c","m":0.020994600000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":192.78179903123205,"a":4.2,"e":0.65,"w":-89,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2500,"temperature":159.10844194973046,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#123EA8","clouds":false},{"name":"KOI-12-b","texture":"KOI-12-b","m":0.0010497300000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1201.3953488372094,"a":0.154,"e":0.34,"w":56.63587307429858,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":17.855182,"temperature":830.916738521169,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-448_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#F4CC1A","clouds":false}]}
