It is located 70.33 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 97658 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 97658 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 97658 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 97658 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2011-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 97658 b is 9.540 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 97658 b is 2.354 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 97658 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
