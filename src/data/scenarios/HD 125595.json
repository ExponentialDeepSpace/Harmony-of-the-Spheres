It is located 92.04 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HD 125595 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 125595 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 125595 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 125595 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 125595 b is 6.36 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.36 Earth masses, HD 125595 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 125595, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 125595","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 125595","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_125595_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 125595","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 125595","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":504000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 125595","m":0.29,"radius":7227.906976744186,"temperature":4691,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 125595-b","texture":"HD 125595-b","m":0.000019086,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":10.178437190094373,"a":0.08,"e":0,"w":302.32838438463887,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":9.6737,"temperature":336.12663582872165,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_125595_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#40079D","clouds":false}]}
