Its discovery was announced in 2020-05. Its semi-major axis is 0.63 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. </p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b is 3.96 times the mass of Earth.   At 3.96 Earth masses, OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
