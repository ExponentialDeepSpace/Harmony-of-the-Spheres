{"name":"K2-201","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The K2-201 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-201 is a star with 0.96 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.88 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-201 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-201 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-201 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-201 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-201 b is 2.544 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-201 b is 1.4 that of Earth.  At 2.544 Earth masses, K2-201 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-201 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-201 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-201 c is 10.812000000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-201 c is 3.286 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-201 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-201, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-201","m":0.96,"radius":8595.348837209303,"temperature":5507,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-201-c","texture":"K2-201-c","m":0.0000324462,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":286.1860465116279,"a":null,"e":0,"w":291.6931920637358,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":22.779878,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B97B9C","clouds":false},{"name":"K2-201-b","texture":"K2-201-b","m":0.000007634400000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":122.09302325581396,"a":null,"e":0,"w":175.42080577188256,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.05979,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#AD437B","clouds":false}]}
