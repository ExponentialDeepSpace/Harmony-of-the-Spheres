It is located 904.36 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10.2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HAT-P-21 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HAT-P-21 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HAT-P-21 b</h1>\n      <p>HAT-P-21 b was discovered by the HATNet observatory, in 2011-12, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-21 b is 1548.660 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HAT-P-21 b is 12.442 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HAT-P-21 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
