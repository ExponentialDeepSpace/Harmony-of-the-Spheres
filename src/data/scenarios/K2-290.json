It is located 896.90 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>K2-290 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-290 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>K2-290 b</h1>\n            <p>K2-290 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-290 b is 10.907399999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-290 b is 3.06 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-290 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>K2-290 c</h1>\n            <p>K2-290 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.30 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-290 c is 246.132 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-290 c is 11.276 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, K2-290 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
