The radius of Kepler-20 e is 0.865 that of Earth.       </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-20 f</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-20 f was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2012-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-20 f is 14.310 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-20 f is 1.003 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-20 f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-20 g</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-20 g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-20 g is 19.970 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-20 g is 4.710 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-20 g is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
