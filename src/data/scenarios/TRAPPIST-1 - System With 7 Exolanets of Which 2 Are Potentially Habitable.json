  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TRAPPIST-1 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TRAPPIST-1 is a star with 0.08 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.12 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TRAPPIST-1 is known to have 7 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 b</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 b is 0.849 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 b is 1.086 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 c</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 c is 1.380 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 c is 1.056 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 d</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 d is 0.410 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 d is 0.772 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 e</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 e was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 e is 0.620 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 e is 0.918 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 e is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      TRAPPIST-1 e orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 f</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 f was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 f is 0.681 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 f is 1.045 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.3, and a semi-major axis of 0.0371 astronomical units, TRAPPIST-1 f could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 g</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 g is 1.342 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 g is 1.127 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 g is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      TRAPPIST-1 g orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 h</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 h was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 h is 0.331 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 h is 0.752 that of Earth.    With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.061935 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1, TRAPPIST-1 h is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
