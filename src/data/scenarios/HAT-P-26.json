{"name":"HAT-P-26","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HAT-P-26 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HAT-P-26 is a star with 1.12 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.87 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HAT-P-26 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HAT-P-26 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HAT-P-26 b</h1>\n      <p>HAT-P-26 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-26 b is 22.26 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HAT-P-26 b is 7.062 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HAT-P-26 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HAT-P-26, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":301770,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HAT-P-26","m":1.12,"radius":8497.67441860465,"temperature":5079,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HAT-P-26-b","texture":"HAT-P-26-b","m":0.00006680100000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":615.3488372093024,"a":0.0479,"e":0.12,"w":46,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.23452,"temperature":1001,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2F9D5C","clouds":false}]}
