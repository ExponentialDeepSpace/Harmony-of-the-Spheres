{"name":"HD 39091","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The HD 39091 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>HD 39091 is a star with 1.09 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.1 times its radius. It is located 59.62 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.98 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HD 39091 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 39091 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 39091 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 39091 b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 39091 b is 3186.3599999999997 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 39091 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 39091 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 39091 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 39091 c is 4.82406 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 39091 c is 2.042 that of Earth.  At 4.82406 Earth masses, HD 39091 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Anglo-Australian Telescope","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 39091, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Anglo-Australian Telescope.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 39091","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 39091","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_39091_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 39091","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 39091","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":19530000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 39091","m":1.09,"radius":10744.18604651163,"temperature":6037,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 39091-c","texture":"HD 39091-c","m":0.000014476731,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":177.7674418604651,"a":0.06839,"e":0,"w":231.1401220831616,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":6.2679,"temperature":1170,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/pi_men_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":0.5,"color":"#F4A8EC","clouds":false},{"name":"HD 39091-b","texture":"HD 39091-b","m":0.009562086000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Anglo-Australian Telescope","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":138.55204678815585,"a":3.1,"e":0.637,"w":330.61,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2093.07,"temperature":145.76003047480233,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_39091_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#20EE2B","clouds":false}]}
