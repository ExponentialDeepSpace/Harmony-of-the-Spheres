It is located 338.55 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>K2-229 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">K2-229 b</h2>\n            <p>K2-229 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2018-02. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 0.58 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-229.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-229 b is 1.33 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-229 b is 1.14 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, K2-229 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">K2-229 c</h2>\n            <p>K2-229 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2018-02. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 8.33 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-229.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-229 c is 5.26 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-229 c is 2.03 that of Earth.  At 5.26 Earth masses, K2-229 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
