At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 436 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W.
