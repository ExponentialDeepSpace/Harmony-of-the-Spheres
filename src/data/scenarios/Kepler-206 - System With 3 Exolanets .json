  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-206 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-206 is a star with 1.05 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.19 times its radius. It is located 1938.82 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-206 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-206 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-206 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-206 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-206 b is 1.870 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-206 b is 1.200 that of Earth.  At 1.870 Earth masses, Kepler-206 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-206 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-206 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-206 c is 3.784 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-206 c is 1.770 that of Earth.  At 3.784 Earth masses, Kepler-206 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-206 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-206 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-206 d is 1.813 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-206 d is 1.190 that of Earth.  At 1.813 Earth masses, Kepler-206 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
