{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HD 331093 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 331093 is a star with 1.03 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.11 times its radius. It is located 163.71 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 331093 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 331093 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 331093 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 331093 b was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2021-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.44 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 331093 b is 477.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 331093 b is 13.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 331093 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202105,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 331093","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 331093","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 331093","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 331093","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":9072000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 331093","m":1.03,"radius":10841.86046511628,"temperature":5544,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 331093-b","texture":"HD 331093-b","m":0.0014314500000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1181.860465116279,"a":1.44,"e":0.59,"w":165.77,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":621.62,"temperature":204.97273515284314,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#06AE82","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system HD 331093, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory.","name":"HD 331093 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"HD 331093 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
