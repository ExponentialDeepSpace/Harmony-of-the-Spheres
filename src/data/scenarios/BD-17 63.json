It is located 112.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>BD-17 63 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the BD-17 63 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>BD-17 63 b</h1>\n            <p>BD-17 63 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.34 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of BD-17 63 b is 1621.8 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, BD-17 63 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system BD-17 63, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"BD-17 63","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"BD-17 63","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/bd-17_63_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"BD-17 63","barycenterMassTwo":"BD-17 63","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":8442000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"BD-17 63","m":0.74,"radius":6739.534883720929,"temperature":4714,"massType":"star"},{"name":"BD-17 63-b","texture":"BD-17 63-b","m":0.00486693,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":104.33450904718529,"a":1.34,"e":0.54,"w":112.2,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":655.6,"temperature":165.81385430968137,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/bd-17_63_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B2435C","clouds":false}]}
