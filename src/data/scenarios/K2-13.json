Its discovery was announced in 2015-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 39.91 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-13.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-13 b is 4.46 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-13 b is 1.89 that of Earth.  At 4.46 Earth masses, K2-13 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
