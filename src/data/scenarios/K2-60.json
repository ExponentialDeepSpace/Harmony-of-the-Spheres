It is located 1626.54 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>K2-60 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-60 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>K2-60 b</h1>\n            <p>K2-60 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-60 b is 135.468 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-60 b is 7.656 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, K2-60 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"K2","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-60, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by K2.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-60","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"K2-60","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-60","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-60","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":283500,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-60","m":0.97,"radius":10939.534883720931,"temperature":5500,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-60-b","texture":"K2-60-b","m":0.0004065318,"discoveryFacility":"K2","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":667.1162790697675,"a":0.045,"e":0,"w":331.1210258894331,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.00265,"temperature":1400,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A75E97","clouds":false}]}
