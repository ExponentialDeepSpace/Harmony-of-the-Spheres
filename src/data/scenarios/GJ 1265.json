Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1265 b is 7.40304 times the mass of Earth.   At 7.40304 Earth masses, GJ 1265 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Calar Alto Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 1265, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Calar Alto Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 1265","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 1265","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1265_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 1265","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 1265","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":163800,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 1265","m":0.18,"radius":1855.8139534883721,"temperature":3236,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 1265-b","texture":"GJ 1265-b","m":0.000022216104,"discoveryFacility":"Calar Alto Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":10.848791251348503,"a":0.026,"e":0.04,"w":282,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.6511,"temperature":412.3036018067383,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1265_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#4BB441","clouds":false}]}
