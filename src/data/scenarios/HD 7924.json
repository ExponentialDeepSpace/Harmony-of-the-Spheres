M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 7924 b is 6.36 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.36 Earth masses, HD 7924 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 7924 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 7924 c was discovered by the W.

The mass of HD 7924 c is 7.86414 times the mass of Earth.   At 7.86414 Earth masses, HD 7924 c is a so called Super Earth.
