It is located 4664.03 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-117 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-117 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-117 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-117 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-117 b is 29.892 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-117 b is 8.059 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-117 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-117 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-117 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-117 c is 585.12 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-117 c is 12.341 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-117 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
