Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 3.13 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-224.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-224 b is 2.12 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-224 b is 1.39 that of Earth.  At 2.12 Earth masses, Kepler-224 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-224 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-224 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 5.93 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-224.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-224 c is 14.72 times the mass of Earth.

At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-224 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-224 d</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-224 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method.
