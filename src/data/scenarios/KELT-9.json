It is located 670.74 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>KELT-9 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the KELT-9 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>KELT-9 b</h1>\n            <p>KELT-9 b was discovered by the KELT-North observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KELT-9 b is 915.8399999999999 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KELT-9 b is 21.196 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KELT-9 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"KELT-North","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KELT-9, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by KELT-North.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"KELT-9","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"KELT-9","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_195689_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"KELT-9","barycenterMassTwo":"KELT-9","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":218106,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KELT-9","m":2.52,"radius":23051.162790697672,"temperature":10170,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KELT-9-b","texture":"KELT-9-b","m":0.002748384,"discoveryFacility":"KELT-North","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1847.0232558139537,"a":0.03462,"e":0,"w":90,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.4811235,"temperature":4050,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_195689_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A09EC0","clouds":false}]}
