It is located 108.46 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 21693 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 21693 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 21693 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 21693 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 21693 b is 8.236 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 21693 b is 2.800 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 21693 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 21693 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 21693 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 21693 c is 17.395 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 21693 c is 4.340 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 21693 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
