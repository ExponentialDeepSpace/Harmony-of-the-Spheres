  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-62 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-62 is a star with 0.69 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.64 times its radius. It is located 981.32 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-62 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-62 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-62 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-62 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 b is 9.540 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 b is 1.310 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-62 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-62 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 c is 4.134 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 c is 0.540 that of Earth.       </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-62 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-62 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 d is 13.992 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 d is 1.950 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-62 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-62 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.43 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 e is 35.934 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 e is 1.610 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-62 f</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-62 f was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2013-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.72 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-62 f is 34.980 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-62 f is 1.410 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-62 f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
