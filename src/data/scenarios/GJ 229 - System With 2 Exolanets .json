It is located 18.77 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 229 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 229 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 229 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 229 c was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory, in 2020-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.34 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 229 c is 7.273 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 229 c is 2.600 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 229 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 229 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 229 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2014-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.90 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 229 b is 8.481 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 229 b is 2.850 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 229 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
