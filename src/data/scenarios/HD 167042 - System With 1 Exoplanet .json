It is located 161.98 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 167042 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 167042 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 167042 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 167042 b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory, in 2008-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.32 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 167042 b is 540.600 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 167042 b is 13.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 167042 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
