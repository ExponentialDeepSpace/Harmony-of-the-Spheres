  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 20781 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 20781 is a star with 0.7 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 117.32 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 20781 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 20781 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 20781 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 20781 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20781 b is 1.940 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20781 b is 1.210 that of Earth.  At 1.940 Earth masses, HD 20781 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 20781 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 20781 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20781 c is 5.342 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20781 c is 2.170 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 20781 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 20781 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 20781 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20781 d is 10.621 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20781 d is 3.250 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 20781 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 20781 e</h1>\n      <p>HD 20781 e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.34 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 20781 e is 14.056 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 20781 e is 3.830 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 20781 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
