{"name":"Kepler-493","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The Kepler-493 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-493 is a star with 1.36 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.54 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-493 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-493 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-493 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-493 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-493 b is 37524 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-493 b is 15.13 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-493 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-493, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":276570,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-493","m":1.36,"radius":15041.86046511628,"temperature":6457,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-493-b","texture":"Kepler-493-b","m":0.11260740000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1318.6046511627908,"a":0.0439,"e":0,"w":131.24236311077473,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.00387658,"temperature":1438,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#FD7C40","clouds":false}]}
