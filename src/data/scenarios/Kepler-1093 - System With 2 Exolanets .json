  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-1093 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-1093 is a star with 1.13 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.2 times its radius. It is located 3499.26 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.95 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1093 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1093 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1093 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1093 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1093 b is 4.452 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1093 b is 1.950 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.31, and a semi-major axis of 0.1685 astronomical units, Kepler-1093 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-1093 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1093 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.39 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1093 c is 4.516 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1093 c is 1.960 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.28, and a semi-major axis of 0.394 astronomical units, Kepler-1093 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
