The mass of Ross 458 c is 1997.59 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Ross 458 c is 13.675 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Ross 458 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, Ross 458 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Las Campanas Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Ross 458, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Las Campanas Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Ross 458","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Ross 458","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ross_458_%28ab%29_c/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Ross 458","barycenterMassTwo":"Ross 458","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":7358400000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Ross 458","m":0.49,"radius":6153.488372093024,"temperature":3621,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Ross 458-c","texture":"Ross 458-c","m":0.005998119048,"discoveryFacility":"Las Campanas Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1191.6279069767443,"a":1168,"e":0,"w":26.570485085285345,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":null,"temperature":4.122636675911257,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/ross_458_%28ab%29_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#274CA8","clouds":false}]}
