It is located 356.66 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.48 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 106315 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 106315 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 106315 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 106315 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-06, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 106315 b is 12.606 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 106315 b is 2.440 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 106315 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 106315 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 106315 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-06, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 106315 c is 15.207 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 106315 c is 4.350 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 106315 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
