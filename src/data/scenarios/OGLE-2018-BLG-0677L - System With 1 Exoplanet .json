  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L is a star with 0.12 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 24722.62 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b</h1>\n      <p>OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b was discovered by the OGLE observatory, in 2020-06, using the microlensing method. Its semi-major axis is 0.63 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b is 3.975 times the mass of Earth. The radius of OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b is 1.820 that of Earth.  At 3.975 Earth masses, OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.63 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L, OGLE-2018-BLG-0677L b is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
