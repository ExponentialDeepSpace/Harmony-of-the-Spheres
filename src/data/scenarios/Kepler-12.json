Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-12 b is 137.376 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-12 b is 19.661 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-12 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-12, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-12","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-12","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-12_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-12","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-12","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":348390,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-12","m":1.17,"radius":14455.813953488372,"temperature":5947,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-12-b","texture":"Kepler-12-b","m":0.0004122576,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1713.2093023255816,"a":0.0553,"e":0,"w":320.2347495445031,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.4379629,"temperature":1480,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-12_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B4158E","clouds":false}]}
