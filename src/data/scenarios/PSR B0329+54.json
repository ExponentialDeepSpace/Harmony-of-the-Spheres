It is located 1646.86 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>PSR B0329+54 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">PSR B0329+54 b</h2>\n            <p>PSR B0329+54 b was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory using the pulsar timing method. Its discovery was announced in 2017-11. Its semi-major axis is 10.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 10140.00 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, PSR B0329+54.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.236, which means that when PSR B0329+54 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 7.84 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 12.68. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of PSR B0329+54 b is 1.97 times the mass of Earth.   At 1.97 Earth masses, PSR B0329+54 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
