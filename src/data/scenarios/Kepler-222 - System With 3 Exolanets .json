  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-222 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-222 is a star with 0.88 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.87 times its radius. It is located 2475.05 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-222 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-222 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-222 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-222 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-222 b is 10.144 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-222 b is 3.160 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-222 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-222 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-222 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-222 c is 19.462 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-222 c is 4.640 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-222 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-222 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-222 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-222 d is 13.197 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-222 d is 3.690 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-222 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
