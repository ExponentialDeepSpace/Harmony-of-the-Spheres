  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Teegarden's Star Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Teegarden's Star is a star with 0.09 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.11 times its radius. It is located 12.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Teegarden's Star is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Teegarden's Star system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Teegarden's Star b</h1>\n      <p>Teegarden's Star b was discovered by the Calar Alto Observatory observatory, in 2019-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Teegarden's Star b is 1.049 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Teegarden's Star b is 1.020 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Teegarden's Star b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Teegarden's Star c</h1>\n      <p>Teegarden's Star c was discovered by the Calar Alto Observatory observatory, in 2019-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Teegarden's Star c is 1.110 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Teegarden's Star c is 1.040 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Teegarden's Star c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      Teegarden's Star c orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
