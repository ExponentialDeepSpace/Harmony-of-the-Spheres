  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 1061 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 1061 is a star with 0.12 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.16 times its radius. It is located 11.98 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 1061 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 1061 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 1061 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1061 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2020-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1061 b is 1.371 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1061 b is 1.100 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, GJ 1061 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 1061 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1061 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2020-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1061 c is 1.739 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1061 c is 1.180 that of Earth.  At 1.739 Earth masses, GJ 1061 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 1061 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1061 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2020-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1061 d is 1.641 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 1061 d is 1.160 that of Earth.  At 1.641 Earth masses, GJ 1061 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     GJ 1061 d orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
