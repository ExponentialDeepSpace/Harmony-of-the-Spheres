  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The 61 Vir Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>61 Vir is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.96 times its radius. It is located 27.73 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8.96 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>61 Vir is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the 61 Vir system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>61 Vir b</h1>\n      <p>61 Vir b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2010-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 61 Vir b is 5.088 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 61 Vir b is 2.110 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, 61 Vir b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>61 Vir c</h1>\n      <p>61 Vir c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2010-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.22 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 61 Vir c is 18.126 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 61 Vir c is 4.460 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, 61 Vir c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>61 Vir d</h1>\n      <p>61 Vir d was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2010-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.48 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 61 Vir d is 22.896 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 61 Vir d is 5.110 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, 61 Vir d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
