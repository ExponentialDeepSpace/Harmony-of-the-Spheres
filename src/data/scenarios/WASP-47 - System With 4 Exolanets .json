  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The WASP-47 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>WASP-47 is a star with 1.04 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.14 times its radius. It is located 863.60 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>WASP-47 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-47 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>WASP-47 b</h1>\n      <p>WASP-47 b was discovered by the SuperWASP observatory, in 2012-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-47 b is 363.293 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-47 b is 12.630 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-47 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>WASP-47 c</h1>\n      <p>WASP-47 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2015-09, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.39 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-47 c is 499.260 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-47 c is 13.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-47 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>WASP-47 d</h1>\n      <p>WASP-47 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2015-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-47 d is 13.108 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-47 d is 3.576 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-47 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>WASP-47 e</h1>\n      <p>WASP-47 e was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2015-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-47 e is 6.834 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-47 e is 1.810 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-47 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
