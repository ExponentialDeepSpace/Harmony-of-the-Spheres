  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 73526 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 73526 is a star with 1.14 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.53 times its radius. It is located 317.15 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9.2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 73526 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 73526 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 73526 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 73526 b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2003-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.65 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 73526 b is 979.440 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 73526 b is 13.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 73526 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 73526 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 73526 c was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2006-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 73526 c is 715.500 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 73526 c is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 73526 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
