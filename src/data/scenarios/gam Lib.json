{"name":"gam Lib","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The gam Lib Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>gam Lib is a star with 1.47 times the mass of the Sun, and 11.1 times its radius. It is located 154.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.82 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>gam Lib is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the gam Lib system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>gam Lib b</h1>\n            <p>gam Lib b was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of gam Lib b is 324.36 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, gam Lib b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>gam Lib c</h1>\n            <p>gam Lib c was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method.
