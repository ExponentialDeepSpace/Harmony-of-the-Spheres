It is located 4357.18 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-308 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-308 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-308 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-308 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-308 b is 5.152 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-308 b is 2.120 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-308 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-308 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-308 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-308 c is 5.311 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-308 c is 2.160 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-308 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
