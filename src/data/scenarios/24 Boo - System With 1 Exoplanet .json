  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The 24 Boo Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>24 Boo is a star with 0.99 times the mass of the Sun, and 10.64 times its radius. It is located 313.07 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.92 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>24 Boo is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the 24 Boo system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>24 Boo b</h1>\n      <p>24 Boo b was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory, in 2018-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 24 Boo b is 289.380 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 24 Boo b is 13.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 24 Boo b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
