  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The PSR B1257+12 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>PSR B1257+12 is a star with 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>PSR B1257+12 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the PSR B1257+12 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>PSR B1257+12 b</h1>\n      <p>PSR B1257+12 b was discovered by the Arecibo Observatory observatory, in 1994-04, using the pulsar timing method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PSR B1257+12 b is 0.019 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PSR B1257+12 b is 0.338 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.85, and a semi-major axis of 0.19 astronomical units, PSR B1257+12 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>PSR B1257+12 c</h1>\n      <p>PSR B1257+12 c was discovered by the Arecibo Observatory observatory, in 1992-01, using the pulsar timing method. Its semi-major axis is 0.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PSR B1257+12 c is 4.303 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PSR B1257+12 c is 1.910 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.39, and a semi-major axis of 0.36 astronomical units, PSR B1257+12 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>PSR B1257+12 d</h1>\n      <p>PSR B1257+12 d was discovered by the Arecibo Observatory observatory, in 1992-01, using the pulsar timing method. Its semi-major axis is 0.46 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PSR B1257+12 d is 3.902 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PSR B1257+12 d is 1.800 that of Earth.  At 3.902 Earth masses, PSR B1257+12 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
