It is located 1577.45 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.16 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>KOI-94 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the KOI-94 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>KOI-94 b</h1>\n            <p>KOI-94 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 b is 10.494 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 b is 1.71 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-94 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>KOI-94 c</h1>\n            <p>KOI-94 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 c is 15.582 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 c is 4.32 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-94 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>KOI-94 d</h1>\n            <p>KOI-94 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method.

The radius of KOI-94 d is 11.27 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, KOI-94 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>KOI-94 e</h1>\n            <p>KOI-94 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.30 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-94 e is 34.98 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-94 e is 6.56 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-94 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system KOI-94, which contains 4 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":4,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"KOI-94","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"KOI-94","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-89_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"KOI-94","barycenterMassTwo":"KOI-94","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1918980,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"KOI-94","m":1.28,"radius":14846.511627906977,"temperature":6182,"massType":"star"},{"name":"KOI-94-e","texture":"KOI-94-e","m":0.000104973,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":571.3953488372093,"a":0.3046,"e":0.019,"w":235.1919187550575,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":54.32031,"temperature":584,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-89_e/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#D4C3AA","clouds":false},{"name":"KOI-94-d","texture":"KOI-94-d","m":0.00031873620000000003,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":981.6279069767442,"a":0.1684,"e":0.022,"w":218.14342797672862,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":22.342989,"temperature":806,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-89_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#BA0CBF","clouds":false},{"name":"KOI-94-c","texture":"KOI-94-c","m":0.0000467607,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":376.046511627907,"a":0.1013,"e":0.43,"w":136.87120691259508,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":10.423648,"temperature":1012,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-89_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#C1AFC1","clouds":false},{"name":"KOI-94-b","texture":"KOI-94-b","m":0.0000314919,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":149.4418604651163,"a":0.05119,"e":0.25,"w":108.5456809327859,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.743208,"temperature":1486,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-89_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#DC5164","clouds":false}]}
