Its semi-major axis is 0.60 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-35 b is 40.386 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-35 b is 8.16 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-35 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-35, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-35","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-35","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-35_%28ab%29_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-35","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-35","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":3801861,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-35","m":0.89,"radius":10060.46511627907,"temperature":5606,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-35-b","texture":"Kepler-35-b","m":0.0001211961,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":711.0697674418604,"a":0.60347,"e":0.042,"w":275.2009398176944,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":131.458,"temperature":283.7684358410679,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-35_%28ab%29_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B25527","clouds":false}]}
