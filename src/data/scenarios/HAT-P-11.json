It is located 123.32 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HAT-P-11 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HAT-P-11 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HAT-P-11 b</h1>\n            <p>HAT-P-11 b was discovered by the HATNet observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-11 b is 23.411160000000002 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HAT-P-11 b is 4.36 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HAT-P-11 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HAT-P-11 c</h1>\n            <p>HAT-P-11 c was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 4.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HAT-P-11 c is 507.27042000000006 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HAT-P-11 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
