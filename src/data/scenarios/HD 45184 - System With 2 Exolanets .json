It is located 71.60 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 45184 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 45184 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 45184 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 45184 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 45184 b is 12.211 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 45184 b is 3.520 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 45184 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 45184 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 45184 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 45184 c is 8.809 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 45184 c is 2.910 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 45184 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
