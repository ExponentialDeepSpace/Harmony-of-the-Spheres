  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The LP 791-18 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>LP 791-18 is a star with 0.14 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.17 times its radius. It is located 86.41 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>LP 791-18 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the LP 791-18 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>LP 791-18 b</h1>\n      <p>LP 791-18 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LP 791-18 b is 1.460 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LP 791-18 b is 1.120 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, LP 791-18 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>LP 791-18 c</h1>\n      <p>LP 791-18 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of LP 791-18 c is 5.947 times the mass of Earth. The radius of LP 791-18 c is 2.310 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, LP 791-18 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
