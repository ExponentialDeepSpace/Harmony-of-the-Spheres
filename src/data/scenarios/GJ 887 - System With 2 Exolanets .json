  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 887 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 887 is a star with 0.49 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.47 times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.88 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 887 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 887 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 887 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 887 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2020-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 887 b is 4.201 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 887 b is 1.880 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.47, and a semi-major axis of 0.068 astronomical units, GJ 887 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 887 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 887 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2020-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 887 c is 7.603 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 887 c is 2.670 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 887 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
