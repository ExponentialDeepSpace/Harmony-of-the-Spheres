It is located 2893.21 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>KOI-3503 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the KOI-3503 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>KOI-3503 b</h1>\n      <p>KOI-3503 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2021-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-3503 b is 9.206 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-3503 b is 1.190 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-3503 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>KOI-3503 c</h1>\n      <p>KOI-3503 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2021-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of KOI-3503 c is 10.367 times the mass of Earth. The radius of KOI-3503 c is 1.210 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, KOI-3503 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
