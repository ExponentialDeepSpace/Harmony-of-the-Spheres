{"name":"HD 3167","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The HD 3167 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>HD 3167 is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.87 times its radius. It is located 154.47 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HD 3167 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 3167 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 3167 d</h1>\n            <p>HD 3167 d was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 3167 d is 6.90378 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.90378 Earth masses, HD 3167 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 3167 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 3167 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.  The radius of HD 3167 b is 1.7 that of Earth.     </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 3167 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 3167 c was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.  The radius of HD 3167 c is 2.86 that of Earth.     </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W. M.
