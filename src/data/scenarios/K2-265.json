It is located 454.07438319999994 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9.7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>K2-265 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-265 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>K2-265 b</h1>\n            <p>K2-265 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the Transit method. The mass of K2-265 b is 6.54 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-265 b is 1.71 that of Earth.  At 6.54 Earth masses, K2-265 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"K2","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-265, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by K2.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-265","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"K2-265","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-265","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-265","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":212688,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-265","m":0.92,"radius":9572.093023255813,"temperature":5477,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-265-b","texture":"K2-265-b","m":0.000019639494,"discoveryFacility":"K2","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":149.4418604651163,"a":0.03376,"e":0.084,"w":53.3945369783039,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2.369172,"temperature":1229.954583959365,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":0.5,"color":"#6B5A10","clouds":false}]}
