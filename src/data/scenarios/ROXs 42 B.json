It is located 440.31 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.003 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>ROXs 42 B is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">ROXs 42 B b</h2>\n            <p>ROXs 42 B b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the imaging method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-01. Its semi-major axis is 157.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. </p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of ROXs 42 B b is 2860.29 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, ROXs 42 B b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
