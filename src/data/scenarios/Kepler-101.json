It is located 3109.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-101 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-101 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-101 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-101 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-101 b is 50.88 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-101 b is 5.77 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-101 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-101 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-101 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-101 c is 3.18 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-101 c is 1.25 that of Earth.  At 3.18 Earth masses, Kepler-101 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
