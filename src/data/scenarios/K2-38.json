Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-38 c is 9.9057 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-38 c is 2.42 that of Earth.  At 9.9057 Earth masses, K2-38 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"K2","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system K2-38, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by K2.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-38","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"K2-38","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-38","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-38","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":607320,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"K2-38","m":2.24,"radius":13479.069767441859,"temperature":5757,"massType":"star"},{"name":"K2-38-c","texture":"K2-38-c","m":0.000029726445000000004,"discoveryFacility":"K2","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":210.97674418604652,"a":0.0964,"e":0,"w":43.47568633813353,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":10.56103,"temperature":858,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#495D4B","clouds":false}]}
