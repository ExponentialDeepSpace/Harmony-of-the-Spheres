  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 3323 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 3323 is a star with 0.16 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.12 times its radius. It is located 17.53 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 3323 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3323 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 3323 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3323 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3323 b is 2.022 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3323 b is 1.230 that of Earth.  At 2.022 Earth masses, GJ 3323 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 3323 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3323 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3323 c is 2.312 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3323 c is 1.320 that of Earth.  At 2.312 Earth masses, GJ 3323 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.1264 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of GJ 3323, GJ 3323 c is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
