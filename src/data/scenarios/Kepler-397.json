It is located 3160.45 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-397 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-397 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-397 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 22.25 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-397.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-397 b is 8.30 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-397 b is 2.46 that of Earth.  At 8.30 Earth masses, Kepler-397 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-397 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-397 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.48 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 135.50 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-397.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-397 c is 76.02 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-397 c is 6.18 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-397 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
