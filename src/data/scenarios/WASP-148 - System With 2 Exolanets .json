It is located 803.50 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>WASP-148 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-148 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>WASP-148 b</h1>\n      <p>WASP-148 b was discovered by the SuperWASP-North observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-148 b is 92.538 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-148 b is 8.093 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-148 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>WASP-148 c</h1>\n      <p>WASP-148 c was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2020-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.21 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-148 c is 127.200 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-148 c is 14.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-148 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
