  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-111 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-111 is a star with 0.84 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.25 times its radius. It is located 653.60 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 12.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>K2-111 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-111 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-111 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-111 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-111 b is 5.292 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-111 b is 1.820 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-111 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-111 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-111 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2020-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-111 c is 11.305 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-111 c is 3.370 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-111 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
