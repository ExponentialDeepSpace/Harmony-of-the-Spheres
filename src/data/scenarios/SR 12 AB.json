Its semi-major axis is NaN astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of SR 12 AB c is 4134 times the mass of Earth. The radius of SR 12 AB c is 12.3 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, SR 12 AB c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system SR 12 AB, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":null,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"SR 12 AB","m":null,"radius":null,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"SR 12 AB-c","texture":"SR 12 AB-c","m":0.012405900000000001,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1074.418604651163,"a":null,"e":0,"w":302.0771717439349,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":null,"temperature":null,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#C5CD19","clouds":false}]}
