It is located 841.85 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-247 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-247 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-247 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-247 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-247 b is 5.152 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-247 b is 2.120 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-247 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-247 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-247 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-247 c is 5.438 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-247 c is 2.190 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-247 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
