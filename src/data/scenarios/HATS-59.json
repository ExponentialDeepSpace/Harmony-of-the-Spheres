It is located 2135.9304128 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HATS-59 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HATS-59 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>HATS-59 b</h1>\n            <p>HATS-59 b was discovered by the HATSouth observatory using the Transit method. The mass of HATS-59 b is 256.17098 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HATS-59 b is 12.621 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HATS-59 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, HATS-59 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>HATS-59 c</h1>\n            <p>HATS-59 c was discovered by the HATSouth observatory using the Radial Velocity method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"HATSouth","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HATS-59, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by HATSouth.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HATS-59","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HATS-59","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hats-59_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HATS-59","barycenterMassTwo":"HATS-59","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":15775200,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HATS-59","m":1.04,"radius":10158.139534883721,"temperature":5670,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HATS-59-c","texture":"HATS-59-c","m":0.01211961,"discoveryFacility":"HATSouth","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":153.05448685024052,"a":2.504,"e":0.083,"w":46.750161006748044,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1422,"temperature":176,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hats-59_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#16FEED","clouds":false},{"name":"HATS-59-b","texture":"HATS-59-b","m":0.0007691658000000001,"discoveryFacility":"HATSouth","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1099.8139534883721,"a":0.06112,"e":0.129,"w":227,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":5.416081,"temperature":1128,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hats-59_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#56DED4","clouds":false}]}
