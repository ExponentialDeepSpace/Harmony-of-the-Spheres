  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-444 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-444 is a star with 0.76 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.75 times its radius. It is located 118.85 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 11.23 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-444 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-444 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-444 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-444 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2015-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-444 b is 0.038 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-444 b is 0.403 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.14, and a semi-major axis of 0.04178 astronomical units, Kepler-444 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-444 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-444 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2015-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-444 c is 0.080 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-444 c is 0.497 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-444 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-444 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-444 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2015-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-444 d is 0.200 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-444 d is 0.530 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-444 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-444 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-444 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2015-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-444 e is 0.099 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-444 e is 0.546 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-444 e is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-444 f</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-444 f was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2015-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-444 f is 0.331 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-444 f is 0.741 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-444 f is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
