It is located 206.94 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 154857 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 154857 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 154857 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 154857 b was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2004-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.29 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 154857 b is 779.100 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 154857 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 154857 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 154857 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 154857 c was discovered by the Anglo-Australian Telescope observatory, in 2014-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 154857 c is 820.440 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 154857 c is 13.200 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 154857 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
