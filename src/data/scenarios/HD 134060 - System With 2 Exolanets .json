It is located 78.32 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 134060 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 134060 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 134060 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 134060 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 134060 b is 10.112 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 134060 b is 3.160 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 134060 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 134060 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 134060 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2019-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.39 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 134060 c is 29.320 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 134060 c is 5.910 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 134060 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
