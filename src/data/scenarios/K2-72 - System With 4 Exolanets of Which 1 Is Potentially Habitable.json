  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-72 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-72 is a star with 0.27 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.33 times its radius. It is located 216.67 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-72 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-72 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-72 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-72 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-72 b is 1.282 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-72 b is 1.080 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, K2-72 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-72 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-72 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-72 c is 1.657 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-72 c is 1.160 that of Earth.  At 1.657 Earth masses, K2-72 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-72 d</h1>\n      <p>K2-72 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-72 d is 1.008 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-72 d is 1.010 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, K2-72 d is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-72 e</h1>\n      <p>K2-72 e was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-72 e is 2.213 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-72 e is 1.290 that of Earth.  At 2.213 Earth masses, K2-72 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     K2-72 e orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
