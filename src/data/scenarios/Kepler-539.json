Its semi-major axis is 0.50 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-539 b is 308.46 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-539 b is 8.373 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-539 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-539 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-539 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit timing variations method.
