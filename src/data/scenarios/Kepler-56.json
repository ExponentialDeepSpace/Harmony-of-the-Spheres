{"name":"Kepler-56","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The Kepler-56 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-56 is a star with 1.32 times the mass of the Sun, and 4.23 times its radius. It is located 3055.95 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-56 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-56 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-56 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-56 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-56 b is 22.26 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-56 b is 6.51 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-56 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-56 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-56 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-56 c is 181.26 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-56 c is 9.8 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-56 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-56 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-56 d was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-56 d is 1783.98 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-56 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-56, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-56","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-56","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-56_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-56","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-56","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":13608000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-56","m":1.32,"radius":41316.27906976745,"temperature":4840,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-56-d","texture":"Kepler-56-d","m":0.005353623000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":108.59576887974984,"a":2.16,"e":0.2,"w":-15,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1002,"temperature":201.5825787942666,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-56_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#D4FB8C","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-56-c","texture":"Kepler-56-c","m":0.000543951,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":853.6744186046512,"a":0.1652,"e":0,"w":82.31134401680455,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":21.40239,"temperature":728.9115817005659,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-56_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#0397CF","clouds":false},{"name":"Kepler-56-b","texture":"Kepler-56-b","m":0.00006680100000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":567.4883720930233,"a":0.1028,"e":0,"w":206.4979297008188,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":10.5016,"temperature":924.0241351389838,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-56_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#C797AC","clouds":false}]}
