  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The BD-11 4672 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>BD-11 4672 is a star with 0.65 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.64 times its radius. It is located 88.61 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7.4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>BD-11 4672 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the BD-11 4672 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>BD-11 4672 b</h1>\n      <p>BD-11 4672 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2015-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of BD-11 4672 b is 206.700 times the mass of Earth. The radius of BD-11 4672 b is 14.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, BD-11 4672 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>BD-11 4672 c</h1>\n      <p>BD-11 4672 c was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2020-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.30 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of BD-11 4672 c is 15.378 times the mass of Earth. The radius of BD-11 4672 c is 4.040 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, BD-11 4672 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
