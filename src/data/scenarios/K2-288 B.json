It is located 214.35 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n        <p>K2-288 B is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">K2-288 B b</h2>\n            <p>K2-288 B b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method.  Its semi-major axis is 0.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 31.39 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, K2-288 B.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of K2-288 B b is 4.52 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-288 B b is 1.9 that of Earth.  At 4.52 Earth masses, K2-288 B b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p>With a semi-major axis of 0.164 astronomical units, and a mass of 4.52 Earth masses, K2-288 B b could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
