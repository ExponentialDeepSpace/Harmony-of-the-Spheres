  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The 55 Cnc Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>55 Cnc is a star with 0.95 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.96 times its radius. It is located 41.05 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 5.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>55 Cnc is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the 55 Cnc system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>55 Cnc b</h1>\n      <p>55 Cnc b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory, in 1997-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 55 Cnc b is 264.131 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 55 Cnc b is 13.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 55 Cnc b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>55 Cnc c</h1>\n      <p>55 Cnc c was discovered by the McDonald Observatory observatory, in 2004-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 55 Cnc c is 54.505 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 55 Cnc c is 8.510 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 55 Cnc c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>55 Cnc d</h1>\n      <p>55 Cnc d was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory, in 2002-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.50 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 55 Cnc d is 1233.204 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 55 Cnc d is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, 55 Cnc d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>55 Cnc e</h1>\n      <p>55 Cnc e was discovered by the McDonald Observatory observatory, in 2004-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 55 Cnc e is 8.084 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 55 Cnc e is 1.910 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, 55 Cnc e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>55 Cnc f</h1>\n      <p>55 Cnc f was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2008-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.79 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 55 Cnc f is 44.838 times the mass of Earth. The radius of 55 Cnc f is 7.590 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, 55 Cnc f is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
