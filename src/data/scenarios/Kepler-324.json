It is located 1659.94 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-324 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-324 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-324 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 4.39 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-324.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-324 b is 1.33 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-324 b is 1.14 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-324 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-324 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-324 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 51.81 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-324.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-324 c is 15.10 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-324 c is 3.15 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-324 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
