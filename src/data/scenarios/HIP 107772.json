Its semi-major axis is 0.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 107772 b is 12.90762 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 107772 b is 3.64 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 107772 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HIP 107772, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1530900,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 107772","m":0.63,"radius":null,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 107772-b","texture":"HIP 107772-b","m":0.000038735037,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":317.4418604651163,"a":0.243,"e":0.18,"w":151,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":55.199,"temperature":345.10535570747453,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B774B7","clouds":false}]}
