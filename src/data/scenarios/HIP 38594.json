{"name":"HIP 38594","scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The HIP 38594 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HIP 38594 is a star with 0.61 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HIP 38594 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 38594 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 38594 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 38594 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.26 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 38594 b is 8.10582 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 38594 b is 2.77 that of Earth.  At 8.10582 Earth masses, HIP 38594 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   With a mass of 8.10582 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.256 astronomical units, HIP 38594 b could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 38594 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 38594 c was discovered by the undefined observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.81 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 38594 c is 48.42504 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 38594 c is 7.94 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 38594 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HIP 38594, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":23971500,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 38594","m":0.61,"radius":null,"temperature":null,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 38594-c","texture":"HIP 38594-c","m":0.000145320804,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":691.5348837209302,"a":3.805,"e":0.16,"w":196,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3477.768,"temperature":85.12741968391296,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#245E23","clouds":false},{"name":"HIP 38594-b","texture":"HIP 38594-b","m":0.000024325107,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":241.25581395348837,"a":0.256,"e":0.17,"w":125,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":60.722,"temperature":328.1911135755296,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#2431F8","clouds":false}]}
