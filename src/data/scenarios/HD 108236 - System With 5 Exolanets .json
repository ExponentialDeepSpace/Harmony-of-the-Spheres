  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HD 108236 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HD 108236 is a star with 0.87 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.88 times its radius. It is located 210.69 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 108236 is known to have 5 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 108236 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 108236 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 108236 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 108236 b is 3.244 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 108236 b is 1.615 that of Earth.  At 3.244 Earth masses, HD 108236 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 108236 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 108236 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 108236 c is 4.929 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 108236 c is 2.071 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.06, and a semi-major axis of 0.062 astronomical units, HD 108236 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 108236 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 108236 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 108236 d is 6.996 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 108236 d is 2.539 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 108236 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 108236 e</h1>\n      <p>HD 108236 e was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 108236 e is 9.731 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 108236 e is 3.083 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 108236 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 108236 f</h1>\n      <p>HD 108236 f was discovered by the CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) observatory, in 2021-01, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.18 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 108236 f is 4.738 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 108236 f is 2.017 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.16, and a semi-major axis of 0.1758 astronomical units, HD 108236 f could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
