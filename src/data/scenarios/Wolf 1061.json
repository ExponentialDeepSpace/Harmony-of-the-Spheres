Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 4.89 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Wolf 1061.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.15, which means that when Wolf 1061 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.03 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.04.
