It is located 129.26 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>TOI-1235 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-1235 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>TOI-1235 b</h1>\n            <p>TOI-1235 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1235 b is 6.91332 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1235 b is 1.738 that of Earth.  At 6.91332 Earth masses, TOI-1235 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
