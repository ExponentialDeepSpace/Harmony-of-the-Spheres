It is located 129.2556228 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>TOI-1235 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-1235 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>TOI-1235 b</h1>\n            <p>TOI-1235 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the Transit method. The mass of TOI-1235 b is 6.91 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1235 b is 1.738 that of Earth.  At 6.91 Earth masses, TOI-1235 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system TOI-1235, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TOI-1235","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TOI-1235","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-1235_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"TOI-1235","barycenterMassTwo":"TOI-1235","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":242235,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-1235","m":0.64,"radius":6153.488372093024,"temperature":3872,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-1235-b","texture":"TOI-1235-b","m":0.000020746482,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":151.3953488372093,"a":0.03845,"e":0.15,"w":343.3764350152544,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.444729,"temperature":754,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/toi-1235_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#B86951","clouds":false}]}
