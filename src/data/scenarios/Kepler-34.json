The mass of Kepler-34 b is 69.92 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-34 b is 8.564 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-34 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-34 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-34, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-34","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-34","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-34_%28ab%29__b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-34","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-34","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":6864480,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-34","m":1.05,"radius":11330.232558139534,"temperature":5913,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-34-b","texture":"Kepler-34-b","m":0.000209946,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":746.232558139535,"a":1.0896,"e":0.182,"w":251.72260194602478,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":288.822,"temperature":239.06051508455695,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-34_%28ab%29__b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#9D3EEE","clouds":false}]}
