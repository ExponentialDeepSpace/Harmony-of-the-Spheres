The mass of Kepler-27 b is 2895.31 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-27 b is 4 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-27 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-27 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-27 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-27 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-27 c is 4385.87 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-27 c is 4.9 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-27 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.
