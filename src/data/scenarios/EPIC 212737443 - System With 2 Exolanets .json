It is located 1096.70 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>EPIC 212737443 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the EPIC 212737443 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>EPIC 212737443 b</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 212737443 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 212737443 b is 7.219 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 212737443 b is 2.586 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 212737443 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>EPIC 212737443 c</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 212737443 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-09, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 212737443 c is 7.696 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 212737443 c is 2.690 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, EPIC 212737443 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
