{"name":"24 Sex","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The 24 Sex Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>24 Sex is a star with 1.54 times the mass of the Sun, and 4.9 times its radius. It is located 235.52 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>24 Sex is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the 24 Sex system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>24 Sex b</h1>\n            <p>24 Sex b was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.33 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of 24 Sex b is 632.82 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, 24 Sex b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>24 Sex c</h1>\n            <p>24 Sex c was discovered by the Lick Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method.
