  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-282 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-282 is a star with 0.79 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.9 times its radius. It is located 4362.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-282 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-282 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-282 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-282 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-282 b is 1.008 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-282 b is 1.010 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-282 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-282 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-282 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-282 c is 1.870 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-282 c is 1.200 that of Earth.  At 1.870 Earth masses, Kepler-282 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-282 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-282 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-282 d is 61.056 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-282 d is 2.460 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-282 d is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-282 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-282 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-02, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.23 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-282 e is 56.286 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-282 e is 3.100 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-282 e is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
