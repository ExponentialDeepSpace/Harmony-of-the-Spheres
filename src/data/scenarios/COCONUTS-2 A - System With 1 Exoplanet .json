  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The COCONUTS-2 A Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>COCONUTS-2 A is a star with 0.37 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.39 times its radius. It is located 35.51 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.475 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>COCONUTS-2 A is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the COCONUTS-2 A system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>COCONUTS-2 A b</h1>\n      <p>COCONUTS-2 A b was discovered by the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) observatory, in 2021-08, using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 7506.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of COCONUTS-2 A b is 2003.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of COCONUTS-2 A b is 12.442 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, COCONUTS-2 A b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
