  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The L 98-59 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>L 98-59 is a star with 0.27 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.3 times its radius. It is located 34.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>L 98-59 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the L 98-59 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>L 98-59 b</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 b is 0.401 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 b is 0.850 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, L 98-59 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 c</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 c is 2.220 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 c is 1.385 that of Earth.  At 2.220 Earth masses, L 98-59 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 d</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 d is 1.940 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 d is 1.521 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.95, and a semi-major axis of 0.0486 astronomical units, L 98-59 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 e</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 e was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-08, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 e is 3.062 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 e is 1.560 that of Earth.  At 3.062 Earth masses, L 98-59 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
