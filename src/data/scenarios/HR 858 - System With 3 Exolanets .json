  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The HR 858 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>HR 858 is a star with 1.15 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.31 times its radius. It is located 104.25 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HR 858 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HR 858 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HR 858 b</h1>\n      <p>HR 858 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 858 b is 4.993 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 858 b is 2.085 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.03, and a semi-major axis of 0.048 astronomical units, HR 858 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HR 858 c</h1>\n      <p>HR 858 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 858 c is 4.420 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 858 c is 1.939 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.33, and a semi-major axis of 0.0674 astronomical units, HR 858 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HR 858 d</h1>\n      <p>HR 858 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HR 858 d is 5.342 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HR 858 d is 2.164 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HR 858 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
