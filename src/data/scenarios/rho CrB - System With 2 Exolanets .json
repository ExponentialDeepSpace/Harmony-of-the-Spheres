  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The rho CrB Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>rho CrB is a star with 0.89 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.36 times its radius. It is located 56.97 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>rho CrB is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the rho CrB system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>rho CrB b</h1>\n      <p>rho CrB b was discovered by the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory observatory, in 1997-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.22 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of rho CrB b is 332.278 times the mass of Earth. The radius of rho CrB b is 13.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, rho CrB b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>rho CrB c</h1>\n      <p>rho CrB c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.41 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of rho CrB c is 25.014 times the mass of Earth. The radius of rho CrB c is 5.380 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, rho CrB c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
