It is located 160.57 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>eps Tau is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">eps Tau b</h2>\n            <p>eps Tau b was discovered by the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its discovery was announced in 2007-05. Its semi-major axis is 1.93 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 594.90 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, eps Tau.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.151, which means that when eps Tau b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 1.64 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 2.22. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of eps Tau b is 2415.36 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, eps Tau b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
