Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.

The radius of K2-158 c is 1.28 that of Earth.  At 1.73 Earth masses, K2-158 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">K2-158 b</h2>\n            <p>K2-158 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2018-02. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit.
