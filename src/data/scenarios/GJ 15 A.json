{"name":"GJ 15 A","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The GJ 15 A Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>GJ 15 A is a star with 0.38 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.38 times its radius. It is located 11.61 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 15 A is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 15 A system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 15 A b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 15 A b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 15 A b is 3.0305400000000002 times the mass of Earth.   At 3.0305400000000002 Earth masses, GJ 15 A b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 15 A c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 15 A c was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.40 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 15 A c is 36.01986 times the mass of Earth.    At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 15 A c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"W.
