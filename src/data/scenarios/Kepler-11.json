It is located 2148.03 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-11 is known to have 6 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-11 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-11 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-11 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-11 b is 1.9080000000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-11 b is 1.8 that of Earth.  At 1.9080000000000001 Earth masses, Kepler-11 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-11 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-11 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-11 c is 2.8619999999999997 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-11 c is 2.87 that of Earth.  At 2.8619999999999997 Earth masses, Kepler-11 c is a so called Super Earth.

The radius of Kepler-11 d is 3.12 that of Earth.  At 7.314 Earth masses, Kepler-11 d is a so called Super Earth.

Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-11 e is 7.95 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-11 e is 4.19 that of Earth.  At 7.95 Earth masses, Kepler-11 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes.

Its semi-major axis is 0.25 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-11 f is 1.9080000000000001 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-11 f is 2.49 that of Earth.  At 1.9080000000000001 Earth masses, Kepler-11 f is a so called Super Earth.

Its semi-major axis is 0.47 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-11 g is 25.122 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-11 g is 3.33 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-11 g is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
