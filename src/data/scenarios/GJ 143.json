It is located 53.26127479999999 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>GJ 143 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 143 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 143 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 143 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the Transit method. The mass of GJ 143 b is 22.7 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 143 b is 2.61 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 143 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>GJ 143 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 143 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the Transit method. The mass of GJ 143 c is 3.7 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 143 c is 0.892 that of Earth.  At 3.7 Earth masses, GJ 143 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 143, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 143","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 143","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_143_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 143","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 143","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1206450,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 143","m":0.73,"radius":6739.534883720929,"temperature":4640,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 143-c","texture":"GJ 143-c","m":0.000011108052,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":78.13953488372094,"a":0.0695,"e":0,"w":247.3451085680592,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":7.78993,"temperature":701,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_21749_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#7B645C","clouds":false},{"name":"GJ 143-b","texture":"GJ 143-b","m":0.000068156106,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":227.58139534883725,"a":0.1915,"e":0.188,"w":98,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":35.61253,"temperature":422,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_143_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#C58C17","clouds":false}]}
