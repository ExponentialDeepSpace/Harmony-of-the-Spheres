  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-411 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-411 is a star with 0.87 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.82 times its radius. It is located 501.22 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.212 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-411 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-411 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-411 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-411 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-411 b is 25.615 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-411 b is 2.401 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-411 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-411 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-411 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-411 c is 26.413 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-411 c is 4.421 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-411 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-411 d</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-411 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2019-04, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-411 d is 15.207 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-411 d is 3.319 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-411 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-411 e</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-411 e was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2019-04, using the transit timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-411 e is 10.806 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-411 e is 3.280 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-411 e is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
