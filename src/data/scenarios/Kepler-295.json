It is located 5829.48 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>Kepler-295 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-295 b</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-295 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 12.65 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-295.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-295 b is 1.56 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-295 b is 1.22 that of Earth.  At 1.56 Earth masses, Kepler-295 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-295 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-295 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 21.53 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-295.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-295 c is 1.39 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-295 c is 1.17 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-295 c is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-295 d</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-295 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method.
