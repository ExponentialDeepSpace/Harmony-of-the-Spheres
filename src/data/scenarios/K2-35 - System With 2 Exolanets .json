  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The K2-35 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>K2-35 is a star with 0.7 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.62 times its radius. It is located 823.86 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-35 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-35 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-35 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-35 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-35 b is 4.388 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-35 b is 1.930 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.35, and a semi-major axis of 0.055 astronomical units, K2-35 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-35 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-35 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2016-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-35 c is 2.302 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-35 c is 1.320 that of Earth.  At 2.302 Earth masses, K2-35 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
