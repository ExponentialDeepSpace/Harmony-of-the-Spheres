{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The GJ 9689 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 9689 is a star with 0.59 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.57 times its radius. It is located 99.87 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 9689 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 9689 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 9689 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 9689 b was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2021-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 9689 b is 9.654 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9689 b is 3.070 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 9689 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202308,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 9689","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 9689","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 9689","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 9689","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":717570,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 9689","m":0.59,"radius":5567.4418604651155,"temperature":3836,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 9689-b","texture":"GJ 9689-b","m":0.000028972548000000002,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":267.6279069767442,"a":0.1139,"e":0.29,"w":173.73,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":18.27,"temperature":453,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B71562","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system GJ 9689, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory.","name":"GJ 9689 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"GJ 9689 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
