It is located 61.05 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HIP 54373 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 54373 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 54373 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 54373 b was discovered by the Las Campanas Observatory observatory, in 2019-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 54373 b is 8.624 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 54373 b is 2.870 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 54373 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HIP 54373 c</h1>\n      <p>HIP 54373 c was discovered by the Las Campanas Observatory observatory, in 2019-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 54373 c is 12.447 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 54373 c is 3.570 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 54373 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
