It is located 1430.23 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-18 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-18 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>Kepler-18 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-18 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-18 b is 6.9959999999999996 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-18 b is 2 that of Earth.  At 6.9959999999999996 Earth masses, Kepler-18 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-18 c</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-18 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-18 c is 17.172 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-18 c is 5.49 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-18 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>Kepler-18 d</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-18 d was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.12 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-18 d is 16.535999999999998 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-18 d is 6.98 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, Kepler-18 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
