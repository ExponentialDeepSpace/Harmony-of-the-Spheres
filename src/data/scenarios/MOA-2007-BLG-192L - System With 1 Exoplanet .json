It is located 3261.56 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>MOA-2007-BLG-192L is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the MOA-2007-BLG-192L system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>MOA-2007-BLG-192L b</h1>\n      <p>MOA-2007-BLG-192L b was discovered by the MOA observatory, in 2008-09, using the microlensing method. Its semi-major axis is 0.62 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of MOA-2007-BLG-192L b is 3.180 times the mass of Earth. The radius of MOA-2007-BLG-192L b is 1.630 that of Earth.  At 3.180 Earth masses, MOA-2007-BLG-192L b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.62 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of MOA-2007-BLG-192L, MOA-2007-BLG-192L b is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
