  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-349 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-349 is a star with 1.02 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.93 times its radius. It is located 3068.23 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.09 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-349 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-349 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-349 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-349 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-349 b is 94.446 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-349 b is 1.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Kepler-349 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-349 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-349 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-349 c is 4.516 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-349 c is 1.960 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.28, and a semi-major axis of 0.105 astronomical units, Kepler-349 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
