  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The tau Cet Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>tau Cet is a star with 0.78 times the mass of the Sun, and NaN times its radius. It is located 11.75 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>tau Cet is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the tau Cet system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>tau Cet e</h1>\n      <p>tau Cet e was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.54 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Cet e is 3.934 times the mass of Earth. The radius of tau Cet e is 1.810 that of Earth.  At 3.934 Earth masses, tau Cet e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     tau Cet e orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>tau Cet f</h1>\n      <p>tau Cet f was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.33 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Cet f is 3.934 times the mass of Earth. The radius of tau Cet f is 1.810 that of Earth.  At 3.934 Earth masses, tau Cet f is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 1.334 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of tau Cet, tau Cet f is likely an icy world.   </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>tau Cet g</h1>\n      <p>tau Cet g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Cet g is 1.752 times the mass of Earth. The radius of tau Cet g is 1.180 that of Earth.  At 1.752 Earth masses, tau Cet g is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>tau Cet h</h1>\n      <p>tau Cet h was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2017-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of tau Cet h is 1.832 times the mass of Earth. The radius of tau Cet h is 1.190 that of Earth.  At 1.832 Earth masses, tau Cet h is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
