  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Pr0211 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Pr0211 is a star with 0.94 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.83 times its radius. It is located 595.93 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.578 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Pr0211 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Pr0211 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Pr0211 b</h1>\n      <p>Pr0211 b was discovered by the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory observatory, in 2012-09, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Pr0211 b is 597.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Pr0211 b is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Pr0211 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Pr0211 c</h1>\n      <p>Pr0211 c was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2016-04, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 5.50 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Pr0211 c is 2477.220 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Pr0211 c is 12.600 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, Pr0211 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
