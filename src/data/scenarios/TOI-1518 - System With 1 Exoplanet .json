{"scenarioDescription":"\n<h1>The TOI-1518 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-1518 is a star with 1.79 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.95 times its radius. It is located 736.75 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-1518 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-1518 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-1518 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-1518 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-1518 b is 731.400 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-1518 b is 21.017 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-1518 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","sortedOrder":0,"hasHabitableWorld":0,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"publishDate":202306,"hasPublishDate":true,"g":39.5,"dt":0.000005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"TOI-1518","cameraPosition":"Free","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"TOI-1518","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"barycenterMassOne":"TOI-1518","barycenterMassTwo":"TOI-1518","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":245070,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":false,"habitableZone":false,"mapMode":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"scale":2100000,"trails":false,"labels":true,"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"TOI-1518","m":1.79,"radius":19046.511627906977,"temperature":7300,"massType":"star"},{"name":"TOI-1518-b","texture":"TOI-1518-b","m":0.00219489,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1831.3953488372094,"a":0.0389,"e":0.01,"w":347.35222607148756,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.902603,"temperature":2492,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#00793A","clouds":false,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}],"hallOfFame":true,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanetary system TOI-1518, which contains 1 exoplanets and was discovered by the Multiple Observatories.","name":"TOI-1518 - System With 1 Exoplanet ","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","fileName":"TOI-1518 - System With 1 Exoplanet "}
