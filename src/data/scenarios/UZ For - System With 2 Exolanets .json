It is located NaN light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>UZ For is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the UZ For system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>UZ For b</h1>\n      <p>UZ For b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2011-09, using the eclipse timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 5.90 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of UZ For b is 2003.400 times the mass of Earth.       At more than 50 Earth masses, UZ For b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>UZ For c</h1>\n      <p>UZ For c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2011-09, using the eclipse timing variations method. Its semi-major axis is 2.80 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of UZ For c is 2448.600 times the mass of Earth.       At more than 50 Earth masses, UZ For c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
