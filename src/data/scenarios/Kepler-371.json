Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 34.76 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-371.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-371 b is 4.46 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-371 b is 1.89 that of Earth.  At 4.46 Earth masses, Kepler-371 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Kepler-371 c</h2>\n            <p>Kepler-371 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the transit method. Its discovery was announced in 2014-03. Its semi-major axis is 0.31 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 67.97 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, Kepler-371.</p>\n            \n            <p>The mass of Kepler-371 c is 3.85 times the mass of Earth.
