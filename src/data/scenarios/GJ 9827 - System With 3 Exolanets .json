  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 9827 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 9827 is a star with 0.61 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.6 times its radius. It is located 96.74 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 9827 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 9827 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 9827 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 9827 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-12, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 9827 b is 4.913 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9827 b is 1.577 that of Earth.  At 4.913 Earth masses, GJ 9827 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 9827 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 9827 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-12, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 9827 c is 0.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9827 c is 1.241 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.42, and a semi-major axis of 0.03925 astronomical units, GJ 9827 c could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 9827 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 9827 d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2017-12, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 9827 d is 4.042 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 9827 d is 2.022 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 2.69, and a semi-major axis of 0.05591 astronomical units, GJ 9827 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
