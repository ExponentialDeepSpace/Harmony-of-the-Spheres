  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-365 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-365 is a star with 1.02 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.05 times its radius. It is located 2713.60 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-365 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-365 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-365 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-365 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-365 b is 4.834 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-365 b is 2.040 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.12, and a semi-major axis of 0.098 astronomical units, Kepler-365 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-365 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-365 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2014-03, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-365 c is 3.339 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-365 c is 1.640 that of Earth.  At 3.339 Earth masses, Kepler-365 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
