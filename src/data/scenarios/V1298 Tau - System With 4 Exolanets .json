  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The V1298 Tau Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>V1298 Tau is a star with 1.1 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.34 times its radius. It is located 352.90 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.023 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>V1298 Tau is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the V1298 Tau system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>V1298 Tau b</h1>\n      <p>V1298 Tau b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.17 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of V1298 Tau b is 75.048 times the mass of Earth. The radius of V1298 Tau b is 10.270 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, V1298 Tau b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>V1298 Tau c</h1>\n      <p>V1298 Tau c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of V1298 Tau c is 26.680 times the mass of Earth. The radius of V1298 Tau c is 5.590 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, V1298 Tau c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>V1298 Tau d</h1>\n      <p>V1298 Tau d was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.11 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of V1298 Tau d is 33.708 times the mass of Earth. The radius of V1298 Tau d is 6.410 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, V1298 Tau d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>V1298 Tau e</h1>\n      <p>V1298 Tau e was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2019-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.31 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of V1298 Tau e is 56.922 times the mass of Earth. The radius of V1298 Tau e is 8.740 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, V1298 Tau e is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
