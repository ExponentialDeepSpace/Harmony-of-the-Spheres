It is located 608.28094 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10.6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>Kepler-10 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-10 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>Kepler-10 b</h1>\n            <p>Kepler-10 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory using the Transit method. The mass of Kepler-10 b is 4.60853 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-10 b is 1.481 that of Earth.  At 4.60853 Earth masses, Kepler-10 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Kepler","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system Kepler-10, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Kepler.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-10","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"Kepler-10","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-10_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-10","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-10","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":108360,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-10","m":0.91,"radius":10353.488372093025,"temperature":5708,"massType":"star"},{"name":"Kepler-10-b","texture":"Kepler-10-b","m":0.00001383735,"discoveryFacility":"Kepler","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":128.93023255813955,"a":0.0172,"e":0,"w":314.14071736332943,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":0.837491,"temperature":2130,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-10_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":0.5,"color":"#28D540","clouds":false}]}
