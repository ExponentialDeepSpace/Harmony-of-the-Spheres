  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The GJ 3293 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>GJ 3293 is a star with 0.42 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.4 times its radius. It is located 65.85 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>GJ 3293 is known to have 4 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 3293 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 3293 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3293 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2015-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.14 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 b is 23.551 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3293 b is 5.190 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3293 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 3293 c</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3293 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2015-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 c is 21.102 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3293 c is 4.870 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3293 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 3293 d</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3293 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.19 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 d is 7.603 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3293 d is 2.670 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, GJ 3293 d is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>GJ 3293 e</h1>\n      <p>GJ 3293 e was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2017-06, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 3293 e is 3.282 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 3293 e is 1.630 that of Earth.  At 3.282 Earth masses, GJ 3293 e is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
