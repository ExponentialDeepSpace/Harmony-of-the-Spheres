The mass of WASP-57 b is 204.68252 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-57 b is 11.769 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-57 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-57 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-57, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by SuperWASP.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-57","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-57","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-57_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-57","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-57","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":237447,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-57","m":0.89,"radius":9083.72093023256,"temperature":5600,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-57-b","texture":"WASP-57-b","m":0.0006145692000000001,"discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1025.5813953488373,"a":0.03769,"e":0,"w":12.412154076288786,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":2.83891856,"temperature":1338,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-57_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A696A2","clouds":false}]}
