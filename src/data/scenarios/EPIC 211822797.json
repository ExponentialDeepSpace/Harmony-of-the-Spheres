It is located 610.53 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n        <p>EPIC 211822797 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n      </section>\n\n        \n            <section style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 18px;\">EPIC 211822797 b</h2>\n            <p>EPIC 211822797 b was discovered by the K2 observatory using the transit method.  Its semi-major axis is 0.13 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. It takes 21.17 Earth days to complete an orbit around its host star, EPIC 211822797.</p>\n            <p>Its eccentricity, the extent to which the shape of the exoplanet's orbit departs from a perfect circle (Earth's is 0.0167, which is why the shape of Earth's orbit is circular rather than oval in appearance), is 0.06, which means that when EPIC 211822797 b is at is at its closest point to its host star, 0.12 astronomical units separates the two, and when it is at its farthest point, this number is 0.14. In the case of Earth, these numbers are 0.9832899 and 1.0167103 respectively.</p>\n            <p>The mass of EPIC 211822797 b is 4.98 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 211822797 b is 1.98 that of Earth.  At 4.98 Earth masses, EPIC 211822797 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            \n            <p></p>            </section>\n\n            </main>\n\n    ",
