{"name":"HD 215497","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The HD 215497 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>HD 215497 is a star with 0.67 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.85 times its radius. It is located 132.39 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>HD 215497 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 215497 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>HD 215497 b</h1>\n            <p>HD 215497 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215497 b is 6.36 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.36 Earth masses, HD 215497 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>HD 215497 c</h1>\n            <p>HD 215497 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.28 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 215497 c is 104.94000000000001 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 215497 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 215497, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 215497","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 215497","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_215497_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 215497","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 215497","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":8076600,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 215497","m":0.67,"radius":8302.32558139535,"temperature":5110,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 215497-c","texture":"HD 215497-c","m":0.00031491900000000004,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":33.03880704602061,"a":1.282,"e":0.49,"w":45,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":567.94,"temperature":157.3481036991053,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_215497_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#DEE3CF","clouds":false},{"name":"HD 215497-b","texture":"HD 215497-b","m":0.000019086,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":10.178437190094373,"a":0.05,"e":0.16,"w":329.9745467630532,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.93404,"temperature":796.7471593389841,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_215497_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#1B818B","clouds":false}]}
