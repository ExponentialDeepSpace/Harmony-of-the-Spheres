{"name":"DMPP-3 A","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The DMPP-3 A Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>DMPP-3 A is a star with 0.87 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.91 times its radius. It is located 159.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 10.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>DMPP-3 A is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the DMPP-3 A system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>DMPP-3 A b</h1>\n            <p>DMPP-3 A b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.07 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of DMPP-3 A b is 2.58216 times the mass of Earth.   At 2.58216 Earth masses, DMPP-3 A b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system DMPP-3 A, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"DMPP-3 A","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"DMPP-3 A","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_42936_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"DMPP-3 A","barycenterMassTwo":"DMPP-3 A","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":417060,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"DMPP-3 A","m":0.87,"radius":8888.372093023256,"temperature":5138,"massType":"star"},{"name":"DMPP-3 A-b","texture":"DMPP-3 A-b","m":0.000007748916,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":6.970469562082381,"a":0.0662,"e":0.14,"w":80.57,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":6.6732,"temperature":854,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_42936_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#B00F3F","clouds":false}]}
