It is located 266.37 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 75092 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 75092 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 75092 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 75092 b was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2021-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 75092 b is 569.220 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 75092 b is 13.500 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HIP 75092 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
