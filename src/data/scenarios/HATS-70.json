It is located 4262.85892 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.81 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>HATS-70 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the HATS-70 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>HATS-70 b</h1>\n            <p>HATS-70 b was discovered by the HATSouth observatory using the Transit method. The mass of HATS-70 b is 4100.007 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HATS-70 b is 15.513 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HATS-70 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, HATS-70 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"HATSouth","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HATS-70, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by HATSouth.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HATS-70","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HATS-70","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hats-70_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HATS-70","barycenterMassTwo":"HATS-70","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":228816,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HATS-70","m":1.78,"radius":18362.790697674416,"temperature":7930,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HATS-70-b","texture":"HATS-70-b","m":0.01231047,"discoveryFacility":"HATSouth","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1351.8139534883721,"a":0.03632,"e":0.18,"w":303.13804908052714,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":1.8882378,"temperature":2730,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hats-70_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#408112","clouds":false}]}
