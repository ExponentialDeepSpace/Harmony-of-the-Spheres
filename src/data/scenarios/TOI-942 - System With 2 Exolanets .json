  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The TOI-942 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>TOI-942 is a star with 0.79 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.02 times its radius. It is located 497.72 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.09 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TOI-942 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-942 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-942 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-942 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-942 b is 826.800 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-942 b is 4.810 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-942 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-942 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-942 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-11, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-942 c is 795.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-942 c is 5.790 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, TOI-942 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
