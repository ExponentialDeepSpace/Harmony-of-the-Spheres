{"name":"GJ 357","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The GJ 357 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>GJ 357 is a star with 0.34 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.34 times its radius. It is located 30.79 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n      <p>GJ 357 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 357 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 357 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 357 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 357 b is 1.84122 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 357 b is 1.217 that of Earth.  At 1.84122 Earth masses, GJ 357 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 357 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 357 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 357 c is 3.4025999999999996 times the mass of Earth.   At 3.4025999999999996 Earth masses, GJ 357 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 357 d</h1>\n            <p>GJ 357 d was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.20 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 357 d is 6.1024199999999995 times the mass of Earth.   At 6.1024199999999995 Earth masses, GJ 357 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   With a mass of 6.1024199999999995 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.204 astronomical units, GJ 357 d could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 357, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 357","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 357","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_357_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 357","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 357","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":1285200,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 357","m":0.34,"radius":3320.93023255814,"temperature":3505,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 357-d","texture":"GJ 357-d","m":0.000018313017,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":true,"radius":10.003223959447931,"a":0.204,"e":0,"w":38.30563492291523,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":55.661,"temperature":220,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_357_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"color":"#074C35","clouds":true},{"name":"GJ 357-c","texture":"GJ 357-c","m":0.00001021101,"discoveryFacility":"Multiple Observatories","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":7.8268982760067045,"a":0.061,"e":0,"w":14.49036975996437,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":9.1247,"temperature":401,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_357_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#65F686","clouds":false},{"name":"GJ 357-b","texture":"GJ 357-b","m":0.000005525397000000001,"discoveryFacility":"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":106.46511627906978,"a":0.035,"e":0,"w":290.9621834756746,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.93072,"temperature":525,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_357_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#00D7FE","clouds":false}]}
