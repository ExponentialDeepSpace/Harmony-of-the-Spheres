It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HIP 116454 is known to have undefined exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HIP 116454 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HIP 116454 b</h1>\n      <p>HIP 116454 b was discovered by the undefined observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HIP 116454 b is 12.72 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HIP 116454 b is 2.466 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, HIP 116454 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","hasHabitableWorld":false,"description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HIP 116454, which contains undefined planets and was discovered by undefined.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":false,"tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":570780,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HIP 116454","m":0.81,"radius":7032.558139534884,"temperature":5089,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HIP 116454-b","texture":"HIP 116454-b","m":0.000038172,"potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":214.88372093023258,"a":0.0906,"e":0.2,"w":-59.1,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":9.1205,"temperature":690,"exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#3F4837","clouds":false}]}
