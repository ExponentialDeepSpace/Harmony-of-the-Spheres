The mass of L 98-59 b is 1.01 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 b is 0.8 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, L 98-59 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.   </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>L 98-59 c</h1>\n            <p>L 98-59 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the Transit method. The mass of L 98-59 c is 2.42 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 c is 1.35 that of Earth.  At 2.42 Earth masses, L 98-59 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.  </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>L 98-59 d</h1>\n            <p>L 98-59 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory using the Transit method.
