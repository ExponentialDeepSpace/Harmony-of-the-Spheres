  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-1445 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-1445 is a star with 1.13 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.26 times its radius. It is located 1651.51 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-1445 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-1445 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-1445 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-1445 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.09 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-1445 b is 0.840 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-1445 b is 0.960 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, Kepler-1445 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
