  "scenarioDescription": "\n<h1>The Kepler-452 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n<br/>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>Kepler-452 is a star with 1.04 times the mass of the Sun, and 1.11 times its radius. It is located 1799.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-452 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-452 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-452 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-452 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2015-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 1.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-452 b is 3.307 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-452 b is 1.630 that of Earth.  At 3.307 Earth masses, Kepler-452 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     Kepler-452 b orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
