It is located 259.46 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.9 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 13908 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 13908 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 13908 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 13908 b was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2014-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.15 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 13908 b is 275.070 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 13908 b is 13.900 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 13908 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 13908 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 13908 c was discovered by the Haute-Provence Observatory observatory, in 2014-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 13908 c is 1631.340 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 13908 c is 12.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 13908 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
