{"name":"GJ 1061","scenarioDescription":"\n      <h1>The GJ 1061 Exoplanetary System</h1>\n      <br/>\n      <h1>Overview</h1>\n      <p>GJ 1061 is a star with 0.12 times the mass of the Sun, and 0.16 times its radius. It is located 11.97 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 7 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>GJ 1061 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 1061 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>GJ 1061 b</h1>\n            <p>GJ 1061 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1061 b is 1.37058 times the mass of Earth.  At less than 1.5 Earth masses, GJ 1061 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.    </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 1061 c</h1>\n            <p>GJ 1061 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1061 c is 1.73946 times the mass of Earth.   At 1.73946 Earth masses, GJ 1061 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>GJ 1061 d</h1>\n            <p>GJ 1061 d was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 1061 d is 1.64088 times the mass of Earth.   At 1.64088 Earth masses, GJ 1061 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.   With a mass of 1.64088 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.054 astronomical units, GJ 1061 d could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system GJ 1061, which contains 3 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":3,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 1061","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"GJ 1061","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1061_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 1061","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 1061","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":340200,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"GJ 1061","m":0.12,"radius":1562.7906976744187,"temperature":2953,"massType":"star"},{"name":"GJ 1061-d","texture":"GJ 1061-d","m":0.000004924188,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":true,"radius":5.761842431604882,"a":0.054,"e":0.53,"w":157,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":13.031,"temperature":211.07581678898728,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1061_d/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"color":"#B5D59A","clouds":true},{"name":"GJ 1061-c","texture":"GJ 1061-c","m":0.000005220021,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":5.904772638405442,"a":0.035,"e":0.29,"w":88,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":6.689,"temperature":262.18107283704614,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1061_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#689EE6","clouds":false},{"name":"GJ 1061-b","texture":"GJ 1061-b","m":0.000004113033,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":5.342308412247584,"a":0.021,"e":0.31,"w":145,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.204,"temperature":338.4743095962246,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1061_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":true,"bumpScale":3,"color":"#14276E","clouds":false}]}
