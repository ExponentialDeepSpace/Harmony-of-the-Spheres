It is located 1901.49 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 4.77 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>WASP-165 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-165 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>WASP-165 b</h1>\n            <p>WASP-165 b was discovered by the SuperWASP-South observatory using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-165 b is 209.244 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-165 b is 14.123 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-165 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP-South","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-165, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by SuperWASP-South.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-165","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-165","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-165_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-165","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-165","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":303849,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-165","m":1.25,"radius":17093.023255813954,"temperature":5599,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-165-b","texture":"WASP-165-b","m":0.0006279294000000001,"discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP-South","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1230.6976744186047,"a":0.04823,"e":0,"w":334.65394117966827,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":3.465509,"temperature":1624,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-165_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#89868D","clouds":false}]}
