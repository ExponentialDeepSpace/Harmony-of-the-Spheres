Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-39 b is 89.04 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-39 b is 14.235 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-39 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system WASP-39, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by SuperWASP.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-39","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"WASP-39","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-39_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-39","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-39","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":306180,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"WASP-39","m":0.93,"radius":8790.697674418605,"temperature":5400,"massType":"star"},{"name":"WASP-39-b","texture":"WASP-39-b","m":0.00026720400000000005,"discoveryFacility":"SuperWASP","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1240.46511627907,"a":0.0486,"e":0,"w":290.8292645746565,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":4.055259,"temperature":1033.4595924297244,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-39_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#6FB0B5","clouds":false}]}
