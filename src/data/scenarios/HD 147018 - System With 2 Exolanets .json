It is located 131.85 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 6.36 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 147018 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 147018 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 147018 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 147018 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2010-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.24 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 147018 b is 674.160 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 147018 b is 13.400 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 147018 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 147018 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 147018 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2010-02, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 1.92 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 147018 c is 2086.080 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 147018 c is 12.700 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 147018 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
