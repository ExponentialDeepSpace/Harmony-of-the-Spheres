It is located 310.26 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>TOI-763 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TOI-763 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TOI-763 b</h1>\n      <p>TOI-763 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-763 b is 9.794 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-763 b is 2.280 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-763 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TOI-763 c</h1>\n      <p>TOI-763 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2020-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TOI-763 c is 9.324 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TOI-763 c is 2.630 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, TOI-763 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
