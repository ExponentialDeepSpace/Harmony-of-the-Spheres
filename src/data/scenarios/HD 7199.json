Its semi-major axis is 1.36 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 7199 b is 85.86 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 7199 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ","discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system HD 7199, which contains 1 planets and was discovered by La Silla Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":1,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 7199","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"HD 7199","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_7199_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 7199","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 7199","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":8568000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"HD 7199","m":0.77,"radius":9474.418604651162,"temperature":5371,"massType":"star"},{"name":"HD 7199-b","texture":"HD 7199-b","m":0.000257661,"discoveryFacility":"La Silla Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":30.368356131389763,"a":1.36,"e":0.19,"w":236.98073580285518,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":615,"temperature":169.56960698090606,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_7199_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#B10233","clouds":false}]}
