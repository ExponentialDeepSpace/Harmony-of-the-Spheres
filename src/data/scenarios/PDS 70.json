It is located 369.9587508 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.005 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>PDS 70 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the PDS 70 system</h1>\n        \n          <article>\n            <h1>PDS 70 b</h1>\n            <p>PDS 70 b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory using the Imaging method. The mass of PDS 70 b is 2542.64 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PDS 70 b is 14.572 that of Earth.   At more than 10 Earth masses, PDS 70 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system. At more than 50 Earth masses, PDS 70 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system.</p>\n            <br/>\n          </article> \n          <article>\n            <h1>PDS 70 c</h1>\n            <p>PDS 70 c was discovered by the European Southern Observatory observatory using the Imaging method.      </p>\n            <br/>\n          </article>\n      </section>\n    ","discoveryFacility":"Paranal Observatory","description":"3D visualisation and gravity simulation of the exoplanet system PDS 70, which contains 2 planets and was discovered by Paranal Observatory.","particlesFun":false,"type":"Exoplanets","pl_pnum":2,"g":39.5,"dt":0.00005,"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"PDS 70","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"rings":[]},"massBeingModified":"Mars","primary":"PDS 70","maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/pds_70_b/","systemBarycenter":true,"barycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"PDS 70","barycenterMassTwo":"PDS 70","tol":0.0001,"maxDt":0.001,"minDt":0.000001,"drawLineEvery":6,"isLoaded":false,"playing":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","customCameraToBodyDistanceFactor":false,"barycenterZ":217350000,"elapsedTime":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"collisions":true,"habitableZone":true,"referenceOrbits":false,"softeningConstant":0,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"scale":2100000,"trails":true,"labels":true,"trajectoryRendevouz":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"p":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"t":0}},"velMax":5,"velMin":-5,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"isMassBeingAdded":false,"a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"masses":[{"name":"PDS 70","m":0.76,"radius":12306.976744186048,"temperature":3972,"massType":"star"},{"name":"PDS 70-c","texture":"PDS 70-c","m":0.010010120307000001,"discoveryFacility":"European Southern Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":141.24248165838517,"a":34.5,"e":0,"w":60.25649907141254,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":null,"temperature":33.3388082007846,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/pds_70_c/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#90F5CD","clouds":false},{"name":"PDS 70-b","texture":"PDS 70-b","m":0.0076344,"discoveryFacility":"Paranal Observatory","potentiallyHabitableWorld":false,"radius":1269.7674418604652,"a":22,"e":0,"w":13.587684880235447,"o":0,"orbitalPeriod":43500,"temperature":1200,"scenarioWikiUrl":"http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/pds_70_b/","exoplanet":true,"bump":false,"color":"#A80789","clouds":false}]}
