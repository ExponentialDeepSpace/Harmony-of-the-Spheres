It is located 369.96 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.005 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n      <p>PDS 70 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n    <br/>\n        <h1>Exoplanets in the PDS 70 system</h1>\n        <br/>\n        \n            <h1>PDS 70 b</h1>\n            <p>PDS 70 b was discovered by the Paranal Observatory observatory using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 22.00 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PDS 70 b is 2544 times the mass of Earth. The radius of PDS 70 b is 14.572 that of Earth.    At more than 50 Earth masses, PDS 70 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n \n            <h1>PDS 70 c</h1>\n            <p>PDS 70 c was discovered by the European Southern Observatory observatory using the imaging method. Its semi-major axis is 34.50 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of PDS 70 c is 3335.65782 times the mass of Earth.     At more than 50 Earth masses, PDS 70 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n            <br/>\n\n    ",
