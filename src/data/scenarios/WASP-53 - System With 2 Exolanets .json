It is located 656.68 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>WASP-53 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-53 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>WASP-53 b</h1>\n      <p>WASP-53 b was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory, in 2017-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-53 b is 677.976 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-53 b is 12.038 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-53 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>WASP-53 c</h1>\n      <p>WASP-53 c was discovered by the Multiple Facilities observatory, in 2017-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 3.73 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-53 c is 5199.300 times the mass of Earth.       At more than 50 Earth masses, WASP-53 c is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n",
